01:20:58 <Fantem> Nighkos "The Director hesitated, but she eventually gave way. She told the stranger where Dr. Bright could be found." Honestly, I'd just have her say where he is instead of narrating it.
01:21:33 <Fantem> (srryBright)
01:21:58 <Nighkos> Fantem:  That's a good point.  I have seem to have show don't tell issues in my writing.
01:24:02 <Fantem> Yeah, I'm noticing that a bit in a few areas, especially around the end of the sections.
01:25:37 <Nighkos> Fantem:  I have trouble recognizing those problems myself, though, despite knowing that is an issue.
01:26:16 <Nighkos> Fantem: So, if you wouldn't mind pointing out specific times where it becomes too much of a problem, I'd appreciate it.
01:28:56 <Fantem> No prob. Generally though, a good rule of thumb is that if you're narrating something that the characters could say themselves in a few lines, it's usually best for it to be so.
01:30:06 <Nighkos> OK.  I'll try to rework some of that.  Thanks.
01:31:20 <Fantem> "Eyes that had seen to much."

01:51:39 <ihp> Can I get some more guys to look over a tale I'm doing for the contest?
01:52:18 <Nighkos> Fantem:  Really?  Thanks.  The dialogue was actually one of my bigger concerns.  I'm glad it worked out OK.
01:59:43 <Nighkos> Right, well, looks like it's about time for sleep.
02:00:01 <Fantem> Nighkos I have work tomorrow, so I'll have to cut it short tonight. So far, I'm intrigued and want to read more. My only suggestion is to either try to include those object notes into the main tale or the hub.
02:00:32 <Fantem> Could we meet tomorrow to discuss the second tale?
02:01:02 <Fantem> Maybe 3 hours from tonight's time?
02:01:13 <Nighkos> Fantem:  Maybe.  I'll be working late tomorrow, but I will try to get on.
02:01:56 <Fantem> Alrighty. Sounds good to me. ≡^ω^≡
02:02:04 <Nighkos> Fantem: By three hours, do you mean three hours later than the  time I first got in Site 17?
02:02:43 <Nighkos> If so, that might be a bit late for me.  However, if I don't see you, I suppose I'll shoot you a PM.
02:02:59 <Fantem> Three hours from now. like, right now, it's 10 where I'm at, so I'd be on at 7.
02:03:37 <Nighkos> Oh, I see.  That might work.  I think I'm only an hour behind you (it is 9 for me).
02:04:29 <Fantem> Alright, sounds like a date. I'll try and get a leg up and read it on my lunch break.
02:04:38 <Nighkos> So, hopefully I'll see you around 8-9pm your time.  Thanks for all the help you've provided so far.

02:11:17 <Fantem> thankya
02:12:57 <Fantem> "His first instinct was to deploy as many spines as possible and attack, but he realized that probably wasn't the best idea."
02:14:43 <Fantem> I'm not sure "deploy" would be the right word to use. Sounds odd in the sentence to me.
02:15:11 <TwistedGears> mm
02:15:15 <TwistedGears> scp-2800
02:15:50 <TwistedGears> hmm grow sounds kinda weird in that context. ...extend?
02:17:09 <Fantem> Maybe... maybe "let loose"?
02:19:09 <TwistedGears> eh that kinda implies he's like releasing them (which he can do) rather than growing them
02:19:14 <Fantem> "Both of them were sitting in collapsible chairs, facing Daniel. Both were dressed casually." could be merged into one sentence.

06:29:27 <PeppersGhost> Are we allowed more than one Sandbox?
06:29:41 <PeppersGhost> 'Cause mine is getting crazy crowded 
06:30:08 <Silber> I think it's fine as long as vou aren't making a new one for everv draft.
06:31:28 <PeppersGhost> ty
06:32:07 <ProcyonLotor> Don't like, wave it around, though.
06:32:23 <ProcyonLotor> We tend to prefer folks have 1 until they're literally at breaking point
06:32:34 <ProcyonLotor> We don't want it to become "oops, don't wanna clean it out, new page time"

06:33:11 <thedeadlymoose> Uh
06:33:22 -!- mode/#site17 [+o Soulless] by ChanServ
06:33:24 <thedeadlymoose> We actually don't care very much at all :P
06:33:44 <thedeadlymoose> Try not to make a new one for every draft; re-use pages unless you made a special significant one that you then retired
06:33:47 <ProcyonLotor> ah
06:33:48 <ProcyonLotor> oh wait
06:33:54 <thedeadlymoose> Don't title them like "SCP-XXXX" or some shit
06:33:57 <ProcyonLotor> Yeah, that was just one staff's opinion
06:33:59 <ProcyonLotor> Sorry
06:34:04 <thedeadlymoose> But, you know, I have like twenty pages.
06:34:08 <thedeadlymoose> Troy has more, I think.
06:34:15 <ProcyonLotor> Admin double standard
06:34:20 * ProcyonLotor founds new wiki with hookers, etc
06:34:32 <PeppersGhost> I've got like 10+ unfinished articles on this one page

06:34:43 <PeppersGhost> So it's not at a breaking point, per se, but it is pretty darn hard to manage 
06:34:51 <ProcyonLotor> But yeah, Moose is right
06:34:54 * ihp looks at peppers.
06:35:02 <ProcyonLotor> I was just conflating an ALL CAPS OPINION with a policy
06:35:04 * ihp looks at his own tale sandbox that has over 20 tabs on it.
06:35:07 <PeppersGhost> (Especially since I don't write short articles)
06:35:08 * ihp laughs pitifully.
06:35:14 <ProcyonLotor> ihp clean out your damn sandbox bro
06:35:31 <ihp> I've actually been forced to recently, because I hit the character limit with every other tale i finish.
