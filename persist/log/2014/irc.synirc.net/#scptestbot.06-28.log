00:41:56 <Pixeltasim> because he made it methinks

00:42:40 <thedeadlymoose> hahahahaha
00:42:42 <thedeadlymoose> yeeeeaaaaaah
00:42:45 * thedeadlymoose that's my SCP ;(
00:43:04 <thedeadlymoose> we'll just have to deal with that, I think, though the author page thing is a bigger deal
00:43:31 <thedeadlymoose> of course this is stopgap time so little flaws like this are okay
00:43:32 <thedeadlymoose> and expected
00:44:40 <Pixeltasim> The issue is those have to be logged individually
00:44:54 <Pixeltasim> cuz there's nothing on the site telling cakebot that you actually wrote that
00:45:34 * thedeadlymoose nods
00:45:36 <thedeadlymoose> yeah
00:45:40 <thedeadlymoose> Nala had the same problem
00:45:42 <TwistedGears> That sounds like quite the endeavor
00:45:49 <Pixeltasim> I could do it
00:45:52 <thedeadlymoose> it's not as bad as it sounds
00:45:57 <thedeadlymoose> it's also not necessary right now
00:46:03 <thedeadlymoose> esp since this is StopGapBot
00:46:09 <Pixeltasim> yep
00:46:19 <TwistedGears> er... stopgapbot?
00:47:04 <Devereaux> Is its final version going to be called cakebot? :||||
00:48:14 <Pixeltasim> ?
00:48:17 <Pixeltasim> I dunno
00:48:21 <Pixeltasim> I'll take bot names now

00:49:00 <thedeadlymoose> It's already named
00:49:02 <thedeadlymoose> Alexandra
00:49:07 <Pixeltasim> kk
00:49:26 <Pixeltasim> Also, thedeadlymoose, are you discussing this with staff?
00:49:27 <thedeadlymoose> Though Crayne wasn't clear --- I thought he had a /separate/ prototype
00:49:33 <Pixeltasim> he did
00:49:40 <Pixeltasim> but he hasn't been on and I'm not sure of his progress
00:49:49 <Pixeltasim> and he was using mostly my code
00:49:53 <thedeadlymoose> he said it was ready to start testing but couldn't start testing yet?
00:49:55 <thedeadlymoose> ahhhh
00:50:02 <Pixeltasim> well to base it off of
00:50:05 <thedeadlymoose> the trouble is, he's on late, so when I talk to him, I'm falling asleep.
00:50:23 <thedeadlymoose> and no I haven't discussed the tells issue with staff
00:50:48 <Pixeltasim> or just the replacement in general?
00:50:56 <thedeadlymoose> of course, right now, I'm falling asleep anyway :P
00:51:04 <thedeadlymoose> how do you mean?
00:51:11 <thedeadlymoose> we've discussed it, yeah, though possibly insufficiently :/
00:51:33 <thedeadlymoose> Ops are aware that we want to bring in CakeBot tonight if possible
00:51:36 <Pixeltasim> like just keeping people on the same page
00:51:38 <Pixeltasim> okay
00:51:49 <thedeadlymoose> though
00:51:51 <thedeadlymoose> am unsure

01:05:12 <thedeadlymoose> I'm not incredibly worried
01:05:20 <thedeadlymoose> eh
01:05:21 <Roget> I'm not either but I'm putting it out there
01:05:32 <thedeadlymoose> we can boot people who bot abuse, and be more clear on the guidelines for that

01:12:45 <weitoobusy> Ahhh
01:12:55 <weitoobusy> I'd imagine that it's slower than Ael's?
01:13:05 <Pixeltasim> yeah a bit
01:13:11 <Roget> We can toss this up on the same server Ael uses, since that one is property of moiphy
01:13:12 <weitoobusy> Mmmh
01:13:14 <Pixeltasim> though I could get it to comparable speeds with time
01:13:17 <weitoobusy> What Roget said
01:13:22 <Pixeltasim> a fair bit of time granted
01:13:34 <Pixeltasim> apparently there is an scp.so server or something
01:14:14 <Roget> Pixeltasim, moiphs is more reliable
01:14:20 <Pixeltasim> roger
01:14:20 <Roget> Although scp.sp is getting better
01:16:17 <thedeadlymoose> actually, we're discussing a solution between Mann & Troy for a VM apparently
01:16:34 <Roget> that stand for Virtual Machine?
01:16:37 <Pixeltasim> I heard troy talking about it
01:16:37 <thedeadlymoose> yes
01:16:40 <thedeadlymoose> murphy's server is far more reliable but murphy is almost impossible to contact
01:16:49 <Roget> that is unfortunate.

01:52:05 <Roget> Pixeltasim, oh one thing I just remembered
01:52:14 <Roget> does she do .errors?
01:52:20 <Pixeltasim> ?
01:52:32 <Pixeltasim> hm
01:52:33 <Pixeltasim> no
01:52:43 <Pixeltasim> but I could add it
01:53:13 <Pixeltasim> scp-2067
01:53:35 <Pixeltasim> I could get a list of pages without tags pretty quickly
01:53:42 <Roget> Pixeltasim, please do, I know it's a great help in cleaning up the series list and finding untagged pages
01:53:47 <Roget> so the tech team'll love you for it
01:53:47 <Pixeltasim> but I might add that tomorrow I'm pretty sleepy right now
01:53:59 <Roget> Yeah that sounds super spiffy
01:54:09 <Pixeltasim> hard to focus
01:54:24 <Pixeltasim> what's the plan for putting it in 19
01:54:43 <Roget> I think that'd be moose's department but I don't know if he's got a specific outline right now
01:54:53 <Roget> Probably once we've got hosting figured out
01:55:01 <Roget> We'd move on to actually tossing it in
01:55:10 <Pixeltasim> gotcha
01:55:26 <Roget> I think he's also in a state of sleep deprivation and talking to his contest team
01:55:29 <Roget> so he's busy
01:55:32 <Pixeltasim> yeah makes sense
01:55:37 <Roget> but that what I said just now is my guess for what our plan is
01:57:03 <Pixeltasim> gotcha
01:58:30 <weitoobusy> If you do that Pix
01:58:31 <weitoobusy> I will love you
01:58:35 <weitoobusy> Adding .errors that is
01:58:42 <weitoobusy> .author weizhong
01:58:48 <weitoobusy> Hmm
01:58:52 <weitoobusy> Oh, there it is
01:58:57 <Roget> .au roget
01:59:34 <Roget> 87?
01:59:39 <Roget> missin' 5 there bub
02:00:24 <Pixeltasim> really?
02:00:35 <Pixeltasim> hm
02:00:43 <Pixeltasim> are they tagged as scp?
02:01:09 <Pixeltasim> it really should count all of them
02:01:37 <Roget> Oh, those might be ones that I've had overriden because of rewrites
02:02:01 <Pixeltasim> yeah that makes sense
02:02:09 <Pixeltasim> can't distinguish re-writes
02:02:28 <Roget> Would it be possible for you to do overrides?
02:02:41 <Pixeltasim> yeah
02:03:11 <Pixeltasim> but again, that'd take some time
02:03:17 <Pixeltasim> and probably finish with the ban list
02:03:41 <Pixeltasim> since they'd have similar function
02:03:59 <Roget> Radical
02:04:00 <Roget> :D
02:04:33 <Roget> Aelanna stopped doing them for me once I got on her shitlist, I have some others that I totally rebuilt but kept the page on
02:04:46 <Pixeltasim> yeah I'd just make it so an op could override
02:04:59 <Roget> right on
02:05:48 <thedeadlymoose> Roget you shouldn't override stuff you just cleaned up pls
02:06:16 <thedeadlymoose> Almost every case in which she argued with you about that, she was right and you were being... I don't even know
02:06:25 <thedeadlymoose> of course in every single case in which she argued with you
02:06:29 <thedeadlymoose> she was a total asshole
02:06:35 <thedeadlymoose> so that didn't help in the slightest
02:06:54 <Roget> thedeadlymoose, there was the one time with 864, which I wasn't going to ask for

02:07:48 <thedeadlymoose> isn't that the one I actually got involved in
02:07:55 <thedeadlymoose> I heard about others but don't really remember much
02:08:11 <Roget> That was, yeah
02:08:29 <thedeadlymoose> anyways I don't think you were out to inflate your author count, just not thinking :P

16:00:22 <djkaktus> Good girl
16:00:27 * Pixeltasim hugs alexandra
16:00:32 <djkaktus> Very cool, very cool
16:00:33 <Pixeltasim> alexandra sucks
16:00:40 <djkaktus> alexandra is cool
16:00:47 <djkaktus> nothing? WELL.
16:00:51 <Pixeltasim> :P
16:00:54 <djkaktus> hahahaha
16:00:57 <Pixeltasim> those are the only two I added
16:01:06 <Pixeltasim> and I'll prolly take em out cuz bot abuse
16:01:17 <djkaktus> Right right
16:01:19 <Pixeltasim> .alexandra
16:01:21 <djkaktus> A stoic bot is best bot
16:01:33 <Pixeltasim> that's thorn
16:01:42 <Pixeltasim> when you hug thorn he just stand's there stoically 
16:01:46 <djkaktus> ahahahah
16:01:53 <djkaktus> So who does the bot hosting?
16:01:54 <Pixeltasim> thorn = wl bot
16:01:57 <Pixeltasim> moi at the moment
16:02:08 <Pixeltasim> and hosting is being worked out by staff from what I can tell
16:02:17 <djkaktus> sure sure
16:02:20 <Pixeltasim> I host thorn too
16:02:26 <djkaktus> that's actually really funny
16:02:27 <Pixeltasim> my computer is basically on all the time
16:02:28 <djkaktus> and fitting
16:02:40 <Pixeltasim> djkaktus: bots with /personality/ :P
16:02:45 <djkaktus> hahaha
16:02:53 <djkaktus> Do you suffer from any performance issues?
16:02:59 <djkaktus> running the bot all the time, that is
16:03:04 <Pixeltasim> nope
16:03:07 <Pixeltasim> they're pretty low impact
16:03:11 <djkaktus> I figured
16:03:12 <djkaktus> but wasn't sure.
16:03:24 <Pixeltasim> maybe if everyone spammed commands all at once I might notice
16:03:31 <Pixeltasim> like everyone in 19 at the same time
16:03:51 <djkaktus> Yeah, sure sure.
16:04:11 <djkaktus> So I don't know anything, but
16:04:21 <djkaktus> this isn't the first time Ael has pulled out of the wiki, is it?
16:04:26 <Pixeltasim> nope
16:04:31 <Pixeltasim> but this is far less ragequity 
16:04:33 <Pixeltasim> and much better handled 
16:04:39 <Pixeltasim> a thousand times better handled
16:04:40 <Pixeltasim> no drama
16:04:47 <djkaktus> That's good. 
16:04:56 <Pixeltasim> yep
16:04:59 <djkaktus> I mean, all I know is what I've seen on O5
16:05:05 <Pixeltasim> yeah
16:05:19 <Pixeltasim> my only real interactions with her have been negative honestly
16:05:25 <djkaktus> I mean
16:05:27 <djkaktus> I'm the same way
16:05:33 <djkaktus> Not necessarily a ton of interactions
16:05:38 <djkaktus> and it's probably better that way
16:06:05 <Pixeltasim> yeah
16:06:39 <djkaktus> anyway. as far as I can tell, good job so far Pixeltasim
16:06:44 <Pixeltasim> thanks
16:06:45 <djkaktus> Obviously we're in good hands
