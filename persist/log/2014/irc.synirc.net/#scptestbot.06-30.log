00:17:01 <Roget> how was din dins
00:17:59 <Pixeltasim> twas good
00:18:02 <Roget> nice
00:18:04 <Pixeltasim> always was/am babysitting my sister
00:18:07 <Pixeltasim> s
00:18:11 <Roget> I'm still installing Far Cry 3 atm
00:18:17 <Roget> but when it's done I'm dong the sword game
00:18:17 <Pixeltasim> it's a big game
00:18:21 <Pixeltasim> kk
00:18:49 <Pixeltasim> I'm gonna stay here for the next 10 mins to make sure everything goes smoothly but then I gotta get back to my sisters
00:18:58 <Roget> right on
00:21:00 <Wogglebug> Pixel, a lot of the listed commands aren't actually in.
00:22:47 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: example?
00:22:51 <Pixeltasim> .help
00:23:05 <Wogglebug> .rottentomatoes Terminator
00:23:20 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: ah, yes
00:23:28 <Roget> Also Pixeltasim, if Resure ever gets the time from University, we could talk to her about doing some integration with her site architecture, if it ever happens. All hypothetical now.
00:23:40 <Pixeltasim> roget: gotcha
00:23:52 <Wogglebug> Hmm? What site?>
00:24:21 <Roget> Wogglebug, the russians have been working on a next-gen site for ages but Resure's not worked on it because she's in University
00:24:28 <Wogglebug> Oh that one
00:24:48 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: I gotta contact sophos and see if we can work those out, but I'll disable them later tonight when nobody is on
00:24:49 <Roget> I've been poking Gene about it, he seems exasperated at the length of time
00:25:04 <Wogglebug> Ahh
00:26:28 <Pixeltasim> man this makes me remember why I don't hang out on scp
00:26:34 <Pixeltasim> 19*
00:26:41 <Pixeltasim> the /chaos/ :P
00:26:43 <Roget> it is a hive of scum and villainy
00:27:03 <Pixeltasim> truly
00:27:07 <Wogglebug> mah
00:29:08 -!- Roget [whose@the.saurus] has joined #scptestbot
00:32:26 <Wogglebug> Hey Pixel, what is the bot written in?
00:32:31 <Pixeltasim> python
00:33:25 <Wogglebug> Is it available to look at? I'm trying to learn python, and I lik practical stuff.
00:33:57 <Roget> I think the Thorn version is on the scp github
00:34:53 <thedeadlymoose> it is
00:35:04 <thedeadlymoose> or at least, it's on a link somewhere
00:37:15 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug:I'm gonna push it to github momentarily
00:37:21 <Wogglebug> Coolio
00:37:33 <Pixeltasim> to replace the thorn one because that's basically skybot 1.0 and alexandra is 1.5 or summat
00:38:11 <Wogglebug> If people see stuff they think might be improved upon, would you want to hear about it, or no?
00:41:35 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:41:48 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:41:59 <Wogglebug> Hmm

00:42:33 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:42:39 <Pixeltasim> booyah
00:43:38 <Wogglebug> The lack of space in 'Rating[+11]' bothers me
00:47:10 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: got multiple complaints, fixed
00:47:15 <Wogglebug> Woo
00:47:17 <thedeadlymoose> I noticed the lack of spacing, but it felt petty to mention it. :D
00:47:35 <Wogglebug> UI is never petty :I
00:47:53 <thedeadlymoose> Pixel: I invited Alexandra into the help channel, 17, as well
00:48:06 <Pixeltasim> thedeadlymoose: It's good
00:55:29 <thedeadlymoose> cool cool
02:03:14 <thedeadlymoose> Pixel, by the way
02:03:26 <Pixeltasim> yes
02:03:29 <thedeadlymoose> My favorite thing about this bot currently is that she always tells you your tells in another window
02:03:34 <thedeadlymoose> unlike most of the bots we have (but like Nala)
02:03:39 <Pixeltasim> yesh
02:03:42 <thedeadlymoose> that's pretty great for logging purposes
02:04:10 <thedeadlymoose> though, as  heads up -- I don't mind this, but -- some people may miss tells if they aren't made to hit .showtells before they appear
02:04:39 <Pixeltasim> not much I can control about tells, I've looked at the plugin but there's a bunch of db stuff that goes into it
02:04:58 <Pixeltasim> I don't wanna goof with it lest I delete everyone's tells
02:05:18 <Pixeltasim> also tdm
02:05:25 <Pixeltasim> tomorrow I wanna get on the infinite ban list
02:05:53 <Pixeltasim> like not get my name on there
02:05:55 <Pixeltasim> but implement it
02:05:56 <Pixeltasim> :P
02:06:11 <Pixeltasim> roget: are you a mod on 05?
02:06:14 <Roget> yes
02:06:35 <Pixeltasim> if you're on could you help me out? the way I wanna do it is have alexandra pull the ban list from an 05 page
02:07:07 <Roget> What do you need done
02:07:33 <Pixeltasim> just a page made, and a ban template established
02:07:45 <Pixeltasim> and have someone add a couple example ones
02:08:22 <Roget> http://05command.wikidot.com/site19-bans
02:08:26 <Roget> something like this?
02:08:33 <Pixeltasim> ...
02:08:49 <Pixeltasim> uhhh
02:08:50 <Pixeltasim> yeah
02:08:52 <Pixeltasim> that'll do
02:09:35 <Pixeltasim> if I could have someone help me revise it so it has the relevant information that'd be good
02:09:39 <thedeadlymoose> We can reformat it.
02:11:23 <Pixeltasim> thedeadlymoose: that'd be good
02:12:06 <Pixeltasim> I'd just want to standardize it so the bot could always read it
02:12:33 <Pixeltasim> anyways, goan to bed

21:33:25 <Roget> How do you want the banlist standardized
21:37:20 <Pixeltasim> roget: here's how I think it should be formatted
21:37:52 <Pixeltasim> well actually quick question, would you rather use tables or have it as text
21:38:12 <Pixeltasim> like either
21:38:52 <Pixeltasim> ||Bob||Perma||N/A||SD8934LAIcomcast.net||
21:39:07 <Pixeltasim> where you can have multiple ips and names by just putting a space between them
21:39:07 <Pixeltasim> or like
21:39:13 <Pixeltasim> Nick:Bob
21:39:16 <Pixeltasim> Status:Perma
21:39:24 <Pixeltasim> Unban:N/A
21:39:29 <Pixeltasim> IP:Yaddayadda
21:39:42 <Pixeltasim> actually
21:39:56 <Pixeltasim> you could take out unban and just have the unban time and date under status
21:40:17 <Pixeltasim> and possibly date banned for archival purposes
21:40:25 <Pixeltasim> and maybe the O5 link
21:40:48 <Roget> I think tables would work better
21:40:52 <Pixeltasim> mmkay
21:41:14 <Pixeltasim> You might wanna create another page, you might not
21:41:26 <Roget> so name, type of ban, date banned, and the ban ip?
21:41:33 <Pixeltasim> Sounds good
21:41:36 <Roget> and then the 05 list what-have-you?
21:41:51 <Pixeltasim> You mind if I create an example page?
21:42:08 <Pixeltasim> That'll let me illustrate what needs to happen better, because the page itself has to be formatted a specific way
21:42:14 <Pixeltasim> I'll just add it to my sandbox
21:42:16 <Roget> Right on
21:42:25 <Roget> I'll copy it over. Do you want me to copy the existing bans to the new format?
21:42:44 <Pixeltasim> If you want them on the ban list, yes, but hold up a minute
21:43:26 <Pixeltasim> and also, the way I'm gonna do it is that alexandra will auto-kick anyone who joins with that ip or nick, and then ban them for an day, then remove the ban so the list don't get cluttered
21:46:00 <Pixeltasim> .test

21:47:11 <Roget> So do I, heh
21:47:16 <Roget> we'll regroup in a bit, eh?
21:58:23 -!- thedeadlymoose [eris@wanderers.net] has joined #scptestbot
22:04:12 <Roget|Dines> back and ready when you are, Pix
22:17:30 <Pixeltasim> roget
22:17:32 <Pixeltasim> okay one moment
22:17:37 <Roget> ok
22:27:00 <Pixeltasim> http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/pixeltasim
22:27:01 <Pixeltasim> roget
22:27:12 <Pixeltasim> I'm going to improv in 15 minutes but I'll work on it when I get back
22:27:20 <Pixeltasim> most of the instructions are on that page
22:27:26 <Pixeltasim> ask me if you have any questions
22:29:17 <thedeadlymoose> "Please note Alexandra must have op status and api access must be available on O5 command."
22:29:27 <Pixeltasim> thedeadlymoose
22:29:31 <Pixeltasim> only api access for now
22:29:31 <thedeadlymoose> This sounds fine, though I'll probably need to enable it (I have access, maybe not knowledge)
22:29:43 <Pixeltasim> op will be in this room only while testing
22:29:46 <thedeadlymoose> But if not, then -- it could be done on the SCP wiki alternatively
22:29:53 <thedeadlymoose> Also, op isn't a problem
22:30:00 <Pixeltasim> thedeadlymoose: And just lock the page for mods?
22:30:03 <thedeadlymoose> Nala was going to get op for this, after all
22:30:10 <Pixeltasim> ah
22:30:13 <thedeadlymoose> Pixel: ...good point, I can't lock the page for mods
22:30:19 <thedeadlymoose> because, uh, half our ops aren't mods
22:30:28 <Pixeltasim> Wouldn't want people un-banning themselves :P
22:30:32 <thedeadlymoose> lol yeah
22:33:11 <Roget> Pixeltasim, so I don't include the banstring in any of these or what-have-you
22:33:23 <Pixeltasim> Roget: Nope, just follow the table
22:33:34 <Roget> right on
22:33:54 <thedeadlymoose> [15:32]	thedeadlymoose	.tell TroyL Any issue with enabling API access for O5 Command so Pixel can set up an auto-ban list for Alexandra? (Alternative is to put it on the SCP wiki... where anyone can edit. Or create another wiki, I suppose)
22:34:06 <Pixeltasim> kk thanks moose 
22:35:19 <Pixeltasim> anyways as it says it'll be a couple of days for me to work on it
22:35:34 <Pixeltasim> it's kind of complicated and there's still some things I gotta figure out
22:36:01 * thedeadlymoose nods
22:36:15 <thedeadlymoose> Thanks. :D
22:36:16 <thedeadlymoose> <3
22:37:01 <Roget> thedeadlymoose, I'm manually transferring the bans to a page on 05. We can move it other places later, but this seems like the best place to have a template we can move all around and such. Okay?
22:37:21 <Pixeltasim> roget: for now just have a page with the test-bans 
22:37:39 <Pixeltasim> I'd like to have some things I can get a measureable result with at first
22:37:47 <Roget> what are the test-bans
22:38:12 <Pixeltasim> like you, or me, or anyone else who wants to help out
22:38:24 <Roget> So have your ip, and mine and such?
22:38:28 <Pixeltasim> yep
22:38:31 <Roget> right on
22:38:35 <Roget> thedeadlymoose, do you want to be banned too
22:39:59 <thedeadlymoose> from here? or from 19
22:40:12 <Pixeltasim> from here for like 5 minutes while testing moose
22:40:20 <thedeadlymoose> sure of course
22:40:22 <thedeadlymoose> that's fine
22:41:02 <Pixeltasim> if you come in here and you get auto-kicked and banned don't worry, that just means something's working :P
22:41:09 <Pixeltasim> anyways I gtg to improv, thanks a bunch roget and moose
22:41:19 <Pixeltasim> when I get back I'll get crackin
22:41:20 <Roget> no problem bro
22:41:31 <Pixeltasim> cy'all
