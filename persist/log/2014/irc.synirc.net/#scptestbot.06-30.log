00:16:55 <Roget> yeppers
00:17:01 <Roget> how was din dins
00:17:59 <Pixeltasim> twas good
00:18:02 <Roget> nice
00:18:04 <Pixeltasim> always was/am babysitting my sister
00:18:07 <Pixeltasim> s
00:18:11 <Roget> I'm still installing Far Cry 3 atm
00:18:17 <Roget> but when it's done I'm dong the sword game
00:18:17 <Pixeltasim> it's a big game
00:18:21 <Pixeltasim> kk
00:18:49 <Pixeltasim> I'm gonna stay here for the next 10 mins to make sure everything goes smoothly but then I gotta get back to my sisters
00:18:58 <Roget> right on
00:21:00 <Wogglebug> Pixel, a lot of the listed commands aren't actually in.
00:22:47 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: example?
00:22:51 <Pixeltasim> .help
00:23:05 <Wogglebug> .rottentomatoes Terminator
00:23:20 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: ah, yes
00:23:28 <Roget> Also Pixeltasim, if Resure ever gets the time from University, we could talk to her about doing some integration with her site architecture, if it ever happens. All hypothetical now.
00:23:40 <Pixeltasim> roget: gotcha
00:23:52 <Wogglebug> Hmm? What site?>
00:24:21 <Roget> Wogglebug, the russians have been working on a next-gen site for ages but Resure's not worked on it because she's in University
00:24:28 <Wogglebug> Oh that one
00:24:48 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: I gotta contact sophos and see if we can work those out, but I'll disable them later tonight when nobody is on
00:24:49 <Roget> I've been poking Gene about it, he seems exasperated at the length of time
00:25:04 <Wogglebug> Ahh
00:26:28 <Pixeltasim> man this makes me remember why I don't hang out on scp
00:26:34 <Pixeltasim> 19*
00:26:41 <Pixeltasim> the /chaos/ :P
00:26:43 <Roget> it is a hive of scum and villainy
00:27:03 <Pixeltasim> truly
00:27:07 <Wogglebug> mah
00:29:08 -!- Roget [whose@the.saurus] has joined #scptestbot
00:32:26 <Wogglebug> Hey Pixel, what is the bot written in?
00:32:31 <Pixeltasim> python
00:33:25 <Wogglebug> Is it available to look at? I'm trying to learn python, and I lik practical stuff.
00:33:57 <Roget> I think the Thorn version is on the scp github
00:34:53 <thedeadlymoose> it is
00:35:04 <thedeadlymoose> or at least, it's on a link somewhere
00:37:15 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug:I'm gonna push it to github momentarily
00:37:21 <Wogglebug> Coolio
00:37:33 <Pixeltasim> to replace the thorn one because that's basically skybot 1.0 and alexandra is 1.5 or summat
00:38:11 <Wogglebug> If people see stuff they think might be improved upon, would you want to hear about it, or no?
00:41:35 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:41:48 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:41:59 <Wogglebug> Hmm
00:42:02 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:42:33 <Pixeltasim> http://www.scp-wiki.net/touchdown
00:42:39 <Pixeltasim> booyah
00:43:38 <Wogglebug> The lack of space in 'Rating[+11]' bothers me
00:47:10 <Pixeltasim> wogglebug: got multiple complaints, fixed
00:47:15 <Wogglebug> Woo
00:47:17 <thedeadlymoose> I noticed the lack of spacing, but it felt petty to mention it. :D
00:47:35 <Wogglebug> UI is never petty :I
00:47:53 <thedeadlymoose> Pixel: I invited Alexandra into the help channel, 17, as well
00:48:06 <Pixeltasim> thedeadlymoose: It's good
00:55:29 <thedeadlymoose> cool cool
02:03:14 <thedeadlymoose> Pixel, by the way
02:03:26 <Pixeltasim> yes
02:03:29 <thedeadlymoose> My favorite thing about this bot currently is that she always tells you your tells in another window
02:03:34 <thedeadlymoose> unlike most of the bots we have (but like Nala)
02:03:39 <Pixeltasim> yesh
02:03:42 <thedeadlymoose> that's pretty great for logging purposes
02:04:10 <thedeadlymoose> though, as  heads up -- I don't mind this, but -- some people may miss tells if they aren't made to hit .showtells before they appear
02:04:39 <Pixeltasim> not much I can control about tells, I've looked at the plugin but there's a bunch of db stuff that goes into it
02:04:58 <Pixeltasim> I don't wanna goof with it lest I delete everyone's tells
02:05:18 <Pixeltasim> also tdm
02:05:25 <Pixeltasim> tomorrow I wanna get on the infinite ban list
02:05:53 <Pixeltasim> like not get my name on there
02:05:55 <Pixeltasim> but implement it
02:05:56 <Pixeltasim> :P
02:06:11 <Pixeltasim> roget: are you a mod on 05?
02:06:14 <Roget> yes
02:06:35 <Pixeltasim> if you're on could you help me out? the way I wanna do it is have alexandra pull the ban list from an 05 page
02:07:07 <Roget> What do you need done
02:07:33 <Pixeltasim> just a page made, and a ban template established
02:07:45 <Pixeltasim> and have someone add a couple example ones
02:08:22 <Roget> http://05command.wikidot.com/site19-bans
02:08:26 <Roget> something like this?
02:08:33 <Pixeltasim> ...
02:08:49 <Pixeltasim> uhhh
02:08:50 <Pixeltasim> yeah
02:08:52 <Pixeltasim> that'll do
02:09:35 <Pixeltasim> if I could have someone help me revise it so it has the relevant information that'd be good
02:09:39 <thedeadlymoose> We can reformat it.
02:11:23 <Pixeltasim> thedeadlymoose: that'd be good
02:12:06 <Pixeltasim> I'd just want to standardize it so the bot could always read it
02:12:33 <Pixeltasim> anyways, goan to bed
02:12:33 <Pixeltasim> gnight
