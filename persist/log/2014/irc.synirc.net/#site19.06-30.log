00:49:19 <FlameShirt> is this a serious question
00:49:19 <Kestin> I was gonna say

00:49:34 <Nemi> i never got drunk until 20 but i'm boring
00:49:35 <Kestin> Not all 16-year-olds are as law-abiding :P
00:49:35 <Vince> so guys, what are some of your favorite low-rated articles/tales? 
00:49:36 <Gujzo> Seriously though I dont wanna drink
00:49:42 <Vorcha> teaflower I know a 16 old who got drunk while pregnant, sucked a dick for cocaine, and then snorted said coke off of said dick
00:49:44 <Vorcha> all in the same night
00:49:47 <RobWatson> drinking is fun
00:49:48 <Kestin> What's the threshold for "low-rated"?
00:49:49 <Vorcha> she wasn't even 16 at the time
00:49:49 <teaflower> wow

00:50:47 <Vorcha> until I smoked a cigarette a few times
00:50:51 <Vorcha> because of stress from an ex
00:50:52 <TheRaven> I'm 20 and haven't even tried drinking
00:50:54 <teaflower> there's rarely alcohol in my house

00:51:03 <teaflower> twenty+ years sober
00:51:13 <teaflower> but the way she puts it is just one drink is too much
00:51:20 <Gujzo> RobWatson who cares at least it means I eat food
00:51:22 <Kestin> Maybe for her it is
00:51:22 <Vorcha> My liver is already shit
00:51:28 <Vorcha> I was born with bad kidneys and liver
00:51:39 <RobWatson> oh
00:52:04 <Kestin> Well, if we have to have a concrete reason not to do it, then I volunteer my lack of verbal filter even when sober. Imagine how awful I'd be drunk

01:15:21 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1: The problem is that you need more than an effect to make a good article.
01:15:27 * Roget knows all his rewrite precursors
01:15:32 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  You need to tell some interesting story.
01:15:35 <Kestin> We can give you feedback on a draft, but we can't write it for you
01:15:37 <Mrtdark1> @Nighkos I am aware.
01:15:56 <Roget> thedeadlymoose, he popped back in about... I want to say a year ago? He tried to edit it. But he didn't add much. I axed it when I re-added the part you liked.
01:15:57 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin I'm not asking for that
01:16:25 <Mrtdark1> Here's what I have for the Brother-making mechanics:
01:16:29 <Nighkos> I'm of the mindset that almsot any effect can be made interesting depending on how you approach it.
01:16:35 <Kestin> Well, you're asking for help coming up with the main idea of the piece, right? I think that's gotta be your territory
01:16:50 <Nighkos> So, I feel that you may be comming at this from the wrong direction.
01:16:52 <Mrtdark1> 1. If you have a sibling, it replaces you
01:16:56 <Kestin> (Don't take my word as law though)

01:17:51 <Mrtdark1> 2. If you do not it A) creates one, or B) replaces you depending on a boy or girl
01:17:51 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  I suppose with an effect like that, you could tell a story about the true meaning of family

01:18:55 <teaflower> do yourself a favor, everyone
01:18:56 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  But the thing is, it's probably better to think of the story you want to tell /first/, and then think about your object effect /second/.
01:18:59 <teaflower> do not bite yourself

01:19:07 <Kestin> Oh, have you featured that fan video about me yet? It's really good
01:19:08 <Dr_Kens> teaflower: That's some good advice.
01:19:30 <Mrtdark1> Ah. Most of the decent ideas I have are generic monsters
01:19:42 <Mrtdark1> Aside from this one:
01:19:46 <Kestin> (Okay, fine, by "me" I mean the goddamn toaster)
01:20:15 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1: Just because you don't know much doesn't necessarily mean that you can't write about it.  You're perspective can still be an interesting one.  I'd say if you're worried about it, do some research on what others have done with a similar topic.
01:20:49 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  Also, like Kestin, I'd like to give you the disclamer that I am also still very inexperienced at this whole SCP thing.
01:20:57 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1: So don't take my word as gospel.
01:21:37 <TwistedGears> My word, however, is holy.

01:40:52 <Dexanote> hrm
01:40:55 <Faminepulse> fuck you bot
01:40:57 <Mrtdark1> Instead of the baby being the focus, it's the parent
01:40:59 <Dexanote> whoa famine
01:41:03 <Dexanote> its still under construction
01:41:06 <Kestin> Yeah, give her some time to get to know the site, eh?
01:41:08 <Soulless> Faminepulse: It's still WIP
01:41:09 <Soulless> calm down
01:41:12 <Faminepulse> Dexanote, im stress testing it

01:42:47 <tahugamin> Mrtdark1: ...?
01:43:11 <Mrtdark1> The kid isn't the source of the Sad Daddy
01:43:18 * Pendragon jump kicks Riemann for no particular reason.
01:43:23 <Mrtdark1> The original dad is
01:43:30 <Riemann> the sadness is the source
01:43:36 <Kestin> Sounds like a human version of the soup bowl
01:43:40 <Kestin> Kinda
01:43:50 <Mrtdark1> @Riemann surpisingly yes
01:44:21 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin not really
01:44:30 <Mrtdark1> It doesn't affect other people
01:44:40 <Mrtdark1> And it isn't humanoid
01:44:48 <Kestin> Doesn't mean it can't remind me of another skip
01:44:55 <Kestin> Even if it isn't exactly the same
01:44:56 <Mrtdark1> It's shaped like a couch
01:45:01 <Kestin> (This isn't feedback, it's just a comment)
01:45:08 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin that's true
01:45:37 <Kestin> How can it be both humanoid and shaped like a couch?
01:45:51 <Mrtdark1> It's made from a person
01:45:53 <Pendragon> It's a man couch.
01:46:04 <Pendragon> Also, you better be using the picture I think you're using.
01:46:09 <Kestin> So how does its anomaly manifest?
01:46:20 <Mrtdark1> @pendragon yes and what picture
01:46:37 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin that's the problem
01:46:53 <Mrtdark1> I don't have that mapped out yet
01:46:58 <Pendragon> There's a chair cut in half that looks like there's meat inside.
01:47:23 <Mrtdark1> @pendragon nah

01:47:49 <Soulless> You all might too
01:47:55 <Kestin> So the guy magically became a couch, or was killed and made into a couch?
01:48:09 <Soulless> "So when you are asked, What does the character want? what your workshop means is, Your story is boring.

01:49:21 <Kestin> Why a couch, though?
01:49:29 <tahugamin> .y be a dentist
01:49:30 <Soulless> tahugamin: ahahhaha

01:49:36 <Kestin> It would make sense if it had something to do with the effect, but you don't have an effect yet

01:50:12 <Soulless> tahugamin: Sometimes when people say show, dont tell, what they mean is that they find the characters sympathetic, the story is moving forward, and they even like the conflict, but they just dont like the way you wrote it.
01:50:14 <Soulless> ahahahahhahaha
01:50:19 <thedeadlymoose> Roget: hahahahahaha
01:50:29 <Pendragon> All dem laughes.

01:50:46 <thedeadlymoose> Roget: hahahahaha
01:50:50 <Roget> and that he had go to home to his mom because the streetlights were on
01:50:51 <Riemann> but there's so much teeeeeeext

02:42:01 <Pendragon> DrYucatan depending on where Smapti lives in japan, Baka could be a serious insult.
02:42:04 <tahunu> DrYucatan: Just blame freddo :V
02:42:10 <Pendragon> Just pointing that out.

02:54:46 <Voct> Pendragon - that can be arranged.
02:54:48 <Voct> for real.
02:55:01 <Voct> it'll cost us a lot of money, but it can seriously be arranged.
02:55:33 <Pendragon> I would sell my solid gold humvee for that.
02:56:39 <DrYucatan> I would kill the President of Kiribati for that.
02:56:49 <DrYucatan> Anote Tong, I'm coming for you, you Pacific motherfucker.
02:56:53 <Voct> in the words of robert pattinson, when he was asked why he took a role in the Twilight movies even though he was going on the record as hating the Twilight novels:
02:56:58 <Voct> "I'm an actor. We're whores."
02:57:10 <Pendragon> He was in a twilight movie?
02:57:25 <Voct> yes, he played the sparkly vampire Edgar.
02:57:57 <Voct> also, on a more serious note
02:58:18 <DrYucatan> Edward, Voct.
02:58:31 <DrYucatan> Not Edgar.
02:58:37 <Voct> DrYucatan, I strongly advise that you not make further death threats against heads of state. That could get you put in prison.
02:58:56 <Pendragon> I need to watch the iron giant.
02:59:07 <Voct> even if it's just the head of state of kiribati
02:59:18 <Pendragon> Where the hell is Kiribati?
02:59:21 <DrYucatan> Voct, you're probably right.
02:59:27 <Voct> Pendragon - pacific ocean
02:59:44 <Voct> DrYucatan - I strongly recommend that you openly retract your death threat against Anote Tong.
02:59:44 <Pendragon> Ah, an island country.

04:10:25 <Dr_Kens> You'll love Alexandra.
04:10:25 <Dr_Kens> Oh yes.
04:10:54 <Pendragon> I still want to make a story where Nala takes over Site 19, and all of us have to shut it down.
04:11:05 <thedeadlymoose> Pendragon: It really was.
04:11:41 <thedeadlymoose> teaflower: watching
04:12:09 <Pendragon> So am I.
04:12:20 <Pendragon> Oh shit, it's an eva core.

04:13:34 <Pendragon> That was... interesting.

04:24:02 <Pendragon> how possible

04:25:01 <Pendragon> Moose, you've watched the rebuilds so far, yes?
04:25:12 <thedeadlymoose> Pendragon: Nope. Waiting them to be done.
04:25:25 <thedeadlymoose> Which... won't be til winter next year earliest. :(
04:25:30 <Pendragon> I would watch them. Their take on the Unit 03 fight is fucking wonderful.
04:25:36 <thedeadlymoose> I know a few spoilers, which sound awesome, but yeah.
04:25:39 <Pendragon> Or at least watch the unit 03 fight.

04:30:45 <Bouncl> are we talking
04:30:46 <Bouncl> about
04:30:46 <Pendragon> Definetly.
04:30:46 <Bouncl> eva
04:30:48 <Bouncl> because
04:30:50 <Bouncl> i fucking love eva
04:31:00 <Pendragon> I was just talking about the rebuilds.
04:31:28 <Bouncl> i love the rebuilds 
04:31:31 <Bouncl> watch the rebuilds moose 
04:31:33 <Bouncl> watch them
04:31:50 <Bouncl> dexanote doesn't like them
04:31:51 <Pendragon> I was just talking about how I have the unit 03's fight song stuck in my head.
04:31:53 <Bouncl> that's how you know they're good 
04:32:08 <Pendragon> And am activley listening to it.
04:32:24 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl I absolutely will. I'm saving them
04:32:28 <thedeadlymoose> They sound amazing
04:32:35 <Bouncl> you don't have to wait for the fourth to come out
04:32:38 <Dexanote> thedeadlymoose: the rebuilds are great
04:32:39 <Bouncl> they're all pretty self contained 
04:32:39 <thedeadlymoose> Also, right now, I'm listening to the Ode to Joy EVA cover
04:32:41 <Dexanote> until the third
04:32:48 <Bouncl> shhh dexanote 
04:32:48 <Dexanote> in which case Shinji actually grabs an idiot ball
04:32:52 * Bouncl puts hand on dexanote's mouth
04:32:56 <Bouncl> your opinion is bad
04:32:58 * Dexanote licks his palm
04:32:58 <Bouncl> feel bad about it 
04:33:05 <Dawley> Rebuild is enjoyable
04:33:14 <Dexanote> really though the rebuilds > series for me
04:33:19 <Dexanote> if only for animation quality
04:33:22 <thedeadlymoose> I recall reading the Rebuild 3 summary and feeling it would work better if I watched it once 3 came out
04:33:23 <Dexanote> and
04:33:24 <Dexanote> fuck
04:33:26 <thedeadlymoose> errrr once 4 came out
04:33:27 <Dawley> End of 3.0 makes you wonder what the hell Anno's going to do wit the fourth film.
04:33:46 <thedeadlymoose> I may give in and watch 1 and 2 though
04:33:47 <Dexanote> thedeadlymoose: seriously watch them when you can. they're really really well done.
04:33:50 <rumetzen> maybe i should finish watching nge one day
04:34:01 <Bouncl> 1 and 2 are basically just the eva redone 
04:34:01 <thedeadlymoose> rumetzen: You should. Watching the first part...
04:34:03 <Bouncl> quite good 
04:34:06 <thedeadlymoose> The first part is just okay
04:34:11 <Pendragon> I don't like the MP eva preview for 4.0.
04:34:17 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl, yeah, except taking the ending and upending it completely in the most amazing way
04:34:27 <thedeadlymoose> from what I read, of course XD
04:34:35 <Bouncl> you don't know man 
04:34:37 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, im gonna be honest
04:34:47 <rumetzen> the converation with doct still makes me not want to
04:34:48 <rumetzen> :|
04:34:55 * rumetzen incredibly petty
04:34:56 <thedeadlymoose> what conversation with burns
04:34:56 <Bouncl> watch them
04:34:57 <Dawley> thedeadlymoose: 1.0 is almost a shot-for-shot remake of episodes 1-6, 2.0 is the same for the first half and then it goes completely off the rails
04:34:57 <Bouncl> for me
04:35:02 * thedeadlymoose doesn't remember at all
04:35:10 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, the big argument we got into
04:35:13 <thedeadlymoose> Dawley: Yeah, I heard -- I read summaries -- and it sounds amazing
04:35:27 <Pendragon> God fucking dammit akinator
04:35:32 <Pendragon> I hate you so much
04:35:36 <thedeadlymoose> rume: I... vaguely remember? Still, though, it's up to you. You can watch what you want~
04:35:36 <Dawley> I got into Eva the same week they released 2.0 on DVD. Good times, no waiting
04:35:42 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, Yeah I know
04:35:48 <rumetzen> I'm really just beng stupid and petty
04:35:50 <rumetzen> like always
04:35:51 <rumetzen> :U
04:35:52 <Pendragon> I saw 1.0 in theaters.
04:35:54 <thedeadlymoose> :P
04:35:57 <Pendragon> It was FUCKING awesome.
04:35:59 <thedeadlymoose> Eva has been a pretty huge influence on me writing wise; I saw it in high school
04:36:12 <thedeadlymoose> I still remember almost all of it
04:36:18 <Pendragon> I do too.
04:36:22 <thedeadlymoose> and I've watched much longer series and remember almost nothing XD
04:36:22 <Pendragon> Besides the filler episodes.
04:36:28 <thedeadlymoose> lol, well, yeah
04:36:34 <thedeadlymoose> It's funny how laser-focused it got
04:36:38 <thedeadlymoose> And from the beginning you're just
04:36:39 <thedeadlymoose> not prepared
04:36:41 <thedeadlymoose> hahaha
04:36:57 <Bouncl> "Sit down young child"
04:36:59 <thedeadlymoose> "wait"
04:37:00 <Bouncl> "I have a story for you"
04:37:03 <Bouncl> "the backdrop is giant robots"
04:37:05 <thedeadlymoose> "what happened to the wacky penguin"
04:37:10 <thedeadlymoose> "...there was a wacky penguin"
04:37:13 <thedeadlymoose> "...help me"
04:37:13 <Pendragon> It's like "hey kid where you expecting gundams TOO BAD HERE COME ENGAGING CHARACTERS AAAHAHAHHAHAHA"
04:37:16 <Bouncl> "the story is why everything is fucking awful and you're all alone."
04:37:24 <rumetzen> Hey
04:37:31 <rumetzen> I'll be 19 in 20 minutes
04:37:37 <thedeadlymoose> "also the apocalypse is the worst/weirdest end to loneliness imaginable"
04:37:39 <Silber> steam summer sale has about 12 hours left --what should I grab while th chance is had

04:38:02 <Silber> rumetzen: oh god vou're three vears voungr than me
04:38:09 <Dr_Kens> rumetzen: DANG MAN YOU YOUNG AS FUCK.
04:38:10 <rumetzen> silber i am
04:38:20 <rumetzen> lol everyone is always shocked to hear how young i am
04:38:20 <thedeadlymoose> Silber: Dishonored is also good
04:38:26 <Bouncl> Silber: 
04:38:27 <thedeadlymoose> So is Dragon Age (better than it sounds)
04:38:29 * MisterFlames doesn't mention how much younger rumetzen is.
04:38:35 <thedeadlymoose> as is Fallout New Vegas
04:38:42 <rumetzen> MisterFlames, quiet gramps
04:38:42 <Silber> I have FONV
04:38:46 <Bouncl> Dishonored, Battleblock Theater, Dark Souls, Xcom, Farcry 3, Fallout 
04:38:49 <Dawley> New Vegas surprised me
04:38:50 <MisterFlames> I need to finish DA:O
04:38:51 <Bouncl> all of those are excellent 
04:39:05 <Silber> I havn't bought anvthing this sale because I have a huge backlog and Sophos is awesome
04:39:09 <Pendragon> Is it bad I have over 120 hours logged on skyrim
04:39:23 <Pendragon> I haven't bought anything because my money is going to computer parts.
04:39:28 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl: I almost got FarCry3 but I haven't played any of the other games
04:39:35 <Bouncl> me neither
04:39:35 <Silber> but
04:39:38 <Bouncl> still good 
04:39:43 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl: and also it seems kind of racist :/
04:39:44 <Silber> I am picking up Retrograde
04:39:49 <Dawley> Check out Blood Dragon. It's awesomeness in a 5 gig package
04:39:56 <Silber> so I might as well grab some other stuff while I'm at it
04:39:59 * thedeadlymoose hates to break that bit out, but it's the main reason I haven't bought it
04:40:03 <Pendragon> it's everything DNF should have been,.
04:40:05 <Silber> like, uh
04:40:07 <Bouncl> fair 
04:40:17 <Silber> Super House of Dead Ninjas
04:40:23 <Bouncl> i never finished it because it crashes at a certain point for me
04:40:24 <Silber> that looks worth $1.25
04:40:32 <Bouncl> but i got a fair bit in and ran around the island and stuff 
04:40:40 <Silber> oh dear it's actuallv $1.74
04:40:45 <Pendragon> One game everyone needs to play: Castle Crashers
04:40:47 <thedeadlymoose> I mean, on one hand, I played resident evil 5 literally to the point of getting every unlock and on hardest difficulty
04:40:51 <thedeadlymoose> but
04:40:51 <Silber> that's wav more expensive
04:40:53 <Silber> also
04:41:00 <thedeadlymoose> I also did that because I did it with my partner on split screen coop :P
04:41:06 <Bouncl> vov
04:41:08 <thedeadlymoose> FarCry3 is just, like, a game
04:41:09 <thedeadlymoose> XD
04:41:12 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, far cry 3 is super fun
04:41:15 <Bouncl> if it makes you uncomfortable do not buy it 
04:41:19 * thedeadlymoose for context, re5 is super racist
04:41:19 <rumetzen> with neat characters
04:41:19 <Pendragon> MGR:R is on sale.
04:41:21 <Bouncl> it's not like
04:41:23 <Bouncl> you're doing a bad thing 
04:41:26 <Silber> Pndragon, Bouncl, whvre were vou to convince me whvn Castlv Crashers and Battleblock were 90% off
04:41:36 <GoldenDragon> Pendragon Rules of nature!
04:41:39 <Bouncl> "oh man this game has fucked up subtext you better buy it or you're a bad person" 
04:41:42 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl: It's partly more that I can't figure out to what extent it will make it unplayable for me from reading previews
04:41:42 <Bouncl> Silber: i was buying it
04:41:45 <Bouncl> where were you 
04:41:45 <thedeadlymoose> hahahahahahahaha
04:42:04 <thedeadlymoose> also, Silber, bioshock infinite, but that's probably obvious
04:42:09 <Pendragon> Found the senior staff boat trip: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/784/892/5f0.gif
04:42:09 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, it was enough for me to "uh wait a minute" so yeah
04:42:16 <rumetzen> you probably wouldn't be a fan
04:42:29 <Silber> being stingv
04:42:35 <Bouncl> plus the main character is just a huge jackass 
04:43:04 <thedeadlymoose> that can be difficult to deal with as well
04:43:10 <thedeadlymoose> maybe I'll buy it when it gets even cheaper
04:43:16 <thedeadlymoose> in like a year or two
04:43:51 <rumetzen> On the bright side, the creators have recognized the problem
04:43:57 <rumetzen> and are trying to fix it with the sequel
04:44:04 <thedeadlymoose> oh, that's cool
04:44:12 <thedeadlymoose> still, the upshot
04:44:15 <thedeadlymoose> dark souls, silber
04:44:23 * thedeadlymoose sidles up to Silber.
04:44:29 * thedeadlymoose whispers in ear.
04:44:34 * thedeadlymoose "Dark Soulsssssssssss."
04:44:59 <Pendragon> Welcome to dark souls
04:45:12 <Pendragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYbOVTQnbAA
04:45:14 <thedeadlymoose> I'm tempted to buy it myself because I don't have it on PC
04:45:18 <thedeadlymoose> But I think I'm being silly
04:45:28 <Pendragon> RIP Flipping Havel
04:45:33 <Bouncl> oh
04:45:39 <rumetzen> The PC version is terrible unless you have a controller
04:45:40 <rumetzen> fyi

04:50:10 * Pendragon is banished to the shadow realm

04:58:49 <Silber> I'm looking at a rviw of Omikron
04:58:52 <Bouncl> i think you are speaking from a pvp perspective 
04:58:55 <Silber> and it has this xplanation
04:58:57 <Bouncl> to which i say this
04:58:59 <Silber> "In fact, you're told, Omikron is a game created by demons in order to capture our souls."
04:59:00 <Bouncl> if you tryhard at pvp
04:59:02 <Bouncl> you are a fucking loser
04:59:10 <Pendragon> You need to git gud.
04:59:24 <Pendragon> You're the one who leveled dex
04:59:28 <Silber> Omikron is the Demon Souls ofthe 90s
04:59:41 <Bouncl> i dunno man
04:59:47 <Bouncl> you seem to care a lot about dex builds
05:00:04 <Pendragon> None are greater than the father of giants.

05:40:05 <Bouncl> rumetzen, you will never not feel like that 
05:40:10 <BlackWing> Shinji needs to get laid
05:40:13 <Bouncl> no
05:40:16 <Bouncl> jesus blackwing
05:40:16 <Kidd> Hmmmm
05:40:16 <BlackWing> Yes
05:40:23 <Bouncl> why
05:40:35 <Bouncl> there's so
05:40:39 <Bouncl> that's
05:40:43 <Bouncl> i'm not having this discussion
05:40:44 <BlackWing> End of Evangelion. Hospital. That is all.
05:40:45 <Pendragon> The rebuild abridged is hilarious.
05:40:53 <Pendragon> BLACKWING STOP
05:40:58 <Pendragon> Stop right fucking there
05:41:02 <Pendragon> We do not talk about that scene
05:41:03 <rumetzen> does rebuild have better animation
05:41:13 <thedeadlymoose> goddammit
05:41:15 <BlackWing> I do believe I said "That is all" as in "Nothing more needs to be said about it."
05:41:15 <thedeadlymoose> lol
05:41:15 <Pendragon> Yes.
05:41:25 <Kidd> Hmmm
05:41:26 <rumetzen> Pemander, is it too...
05:41:28 <rumetzen> fucked up?
05:41:30 <Pendragon> @Rumetzen
05:41:31 <thedeadlymoose> rume: rebuild isn't done, and also I think works better as a sequel
05:41:34 * rumetzen terrible at puns
05:41:36 <BlackWing> Rebuild has *so* much better animation
05:41:38 <thedeadlymoose> I mean...
05:41:42 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, hm
05:41:43 <Bouncl> rumetzen by far 
05:41:44 <Pendragon> Rebuild is also pretty different
05:41:50 <rumetzen> I'm gona be honest
05:41:53 <Pendragon> Like a 3rd angel and no DDR angel
05:41:56 <thedeadlymoose> the thing with evangelion + rebuild is that while the second is technically a reboot
05:42:00 <rumetzen> I'm still not 100% what the fuck NGE is about
05:42:00 <rumetzen> like
05:42:03 <rumetzen> there are angels
05:42:04 <rumetzen> and mecha
05:42:06 <thedeadlymoose> it's also implied to be in continuity with the first
05:42:09 <Pemander> I was pinged.
05:42:09 <rumetzen> and one of the mecha is his mom?
05:42:15 <rumetzen> or maybe im misremembering thing
05:42:15 <thedeadlymoose> rume: souls
05:42:16 <Pemander> Why/!
05:42:18 <BlackWing> rumetzen: All the Evas are mothers
05:42:19 <thedeadlymoose> nah, you're right
05:42:29 <rumetzen> and like
05:42:31 <Bouncl> man guys
05:42:31 <Pendragon> Rumetzen: the best way to explain is to just watch it.
05:42:32 <BlackWing> Asuka's mom's soul is in her Eva
05:42:32 <rumetzen> the ending gets weird
05:42:32 <Bouncl> don't spoil it 
05:42:36 <Pendragon> WAIT WHAT
05:42:37 <thedeadlymoose> hahahaha
05:42:39 <rumetzen> and i think there's alternate universes somehow
05:42:42 <Bouncl> you motherfuckers
05:42:43 <rumetzen> that's really all i know
05:42:43 <thedeadlymoose> okay let's probably stop spoiling
05:42:44 <Pendragon> Blackwing I didn't even know that
05:42:46 <Bouncl> ruining the experience 
05:42:49 <thedeadlymoose> rume: not... quite
05:42:52 <BlackWing> Pendragon: You didn't?
05:42:53 <thedeadlymoose> more like
05:42:55 <thedeadlymoose> in sequence
05:42:56 <Pemander> Oh, rumetzen said my name by MISTAKE.
05:43:00 <Pemander> I see how it is.
05:43:06 <thedeadlymoose> XD
05:43:08 <Bouncl> rumetzen doesn't love you like i do Pemander 
05:43:15 <rumetzen> Pemander, oh shit yeah
05:43:19 <rumetzen> i meant to ping pendragon
05:43:21 <rumetzen> :U
05:43:30 <rumetzen> anyone
05:43:34 <Pemander> No one loves me quite like you do, Bouncl.
05:43:40 <Bouncl> <3
05:43:42 <rumetzen> i guess it's time to watch shinji beat the shit out of bird-skullface
05:43:48 <Bouncl> yeah 
05:43:51 <Pendragon> Blackwing I didn't. I know most everything els
05:44:06 <Pendragon> Sachiel is a pretty meh angel.
05:44:11 <Pendragon> Standard fare first angel.
05:44:25 <Pendragon> They REALLY get interesting at the 9th on.
05:45:01 <rumetzen> I think I've watched up to the big diamond one before
05:45:08 <rumetzen> but I'm starting at the beginning this time
05:45:12 <Pendragon> Ramiel is weird.
05:45:16 <Pendragon> One of the strongest.
05:46:27 <Pendragon> I know most of the Angel's names.
05:51:08 <BlackWing> Pendragon: Yea, Asuka's mother is in her Eva. S'why she went cuckoo and hanged a doll believing it was Asuka
05:51:40 <BlackWing> The part of Asuka's mother that loved her daughter
05:51:53 <Pendragon> God the Arael episode was creepy.
05:51:56 <BlackWing> Or some mysticism mumbo-jumbo

06:37:47 <ProcyonLotor> spoiler alert?
06:38:19 <MorgiePie> I think that one was 6 characters in a room?
06:38:25 <MorgiePie> Can't remember the number but w/e
06:38:31 <ProcyonLotor> yeah
06:38:34 <ProcyonLotor> there were like

06:38:39 <ProcyonLotor> in a circular room

06:55:36 <PeppersGhost> Analysis: Nope, sorry. Back to the drawing board. 
06:55:47 <Bunton> Stab the subjects in the head.
06:56:23 <PeppersGhost> MorganPie: The foundation has a surplus of pale, emotionless things that kill for no reason. 
06:56:33 <MorgiePie> Yeah, I know
06:56:38 <Bunton> "Any matter that enters this red colored area will be [DATA EXPUNGED] and become unrecoverable"
06:56:49 <Bunton> What is behind this data expunged?
06:57:14 <PeppersGhost> "Agent ██████ has not been reprimanded for his actions."
06:57:16 <PeppersGhost> No. 
06:57:23 <PeppersGhost> He would certainly be reprimanded for killing a skip.
06:57:28 <Bunton> ^
06:57:31 <Bunton> Also "SCP-XXXX-1 appears to expand in radius approximately ██cm every █ minutes"
06:57:35 <Bunton> Why are these numbers redacted?
06:57:49 <PeppersGhost> These things violate the laws of reality. There's no telling if the universe would remain in one piece if these anomalies are killed.
06:57:50 <MorgiePie> K
06:58:11 <MorgiePie> Well, that was kinda the point I was going for
06:58:14 <PeppersGhost> So would Agent Blackbox be reprimanded for potentially blowing up reality?
06:58:17 <PeppersGhost> Yes, yes he would.
06:58:29 <JConwell> Heh
06:58:40 <MorgiePie> How should he be reprimanded, termination, just don't even bring it up?
06:59:17 <PeppersGhost> I think that's kind of a moot point since this whole thing seems to be built on some very shaky concepts
06:59:36 <PeppersGhost> It's like you have two completely different SCPs in this one article, and unfortunately, neither of them is very original or interesting
06:59:43 <Bunton> I'm going to ask the question I always ask.
06:59:48 <MorgiePie> Go for it
06:59:55 <Bunton> What emotion is this supposed to evoke in me, and how is it supposed to evoke that?
06:59:58 <PeppersGhost> I mean, we have over 2000 of these articles. You're going to have to show us something really, truly original if you want to get our attention.
07:00:45 <Bunton> It doesn't have to be something /huge/.
07:00:49 <Bunton> It just has to be different.
07:01:16 <MorgiePie> Well, I suppose the emotion I would like to evoke in the reader is intrigue. 
07:01:21 <MorgiePie> But I see y'alls point
07:01:25 <Bunton> But all good articles evoke some emotion, and you can always identify how that's evoked.
07:01:27 <Bunton> Why?
07:01:28 <MorgiePie> It ain't too good
07:01:33 <Bunton> Why should I be interested in it?
07:01:39 <MorgiePie> Good question
07:01:50 <Bunton> Not in a critical way, but you should always be asking yourself that.
07:01:51 <Randomini> intrigue is boring.
07:02:07 <Bunton> Intrigue is a general emotion that's not really enough by itself.
07:02:19 <Bunton> What you should be asking is "what about this makes me curious?"
07:02:23 <Bunton> "What do I want to understand?"
07:02:30 <MorgiePie> Yeah
07:02:30 <MorgiePie> Hmm
07:02:40 <MorgiePie> Back to the drawling board with me, then. 
07:02:42 <Bunton> "What in this article am I invested in? Do I care about these people?"
07:02:51 <Bunton> Yeah. Don't be discouraged.
07:02:58 <Bunton> It just takes a bit of practice.
07:03:03 <MorgiePie> Oh I never get too discouraged 
07:03:14 <MorgiePie> Thanks for y'alls help
07:03:14 <Bunton> :)
07:03:27 <MorgiePie> Well, at least this one had something of a story
07:03:34 <MorgiePie> Something my last two can't really say.
07:03:34 <Bunton> No problem. Don't worry about asking for help if you need any.
07:03:47 <Bunton> Try bouncing ideas off of people.
07:03:55 <MorgiePie> Sounds like a good idea
07:04:02 <MorgiePie> I think, if I had a solid idea, a premise
07:04:06 <MorgiePie> I would do a lot better
07:04:09 <Bunton> People sometimes say it's not in the idea, it's in the execution, but that's only really true if you've been writing scips for a while.
07:04:20 <Bunton> Having a good idea makes the execution a fup-ton easier.
07:04:33 <MorgiePie> Woo, 2000 scips 
07:04:45 <MorgiePie> Finding an original idea is gonna be a pisser. 
07:04:46 <Bunton> Also it's a lot easier to just examine the idea rather than having to extrapolate it from the article.
07:04:59 <Bunton> There's always something different. People will have suggestions.
07:05:23 <MorgiePie> Well, thanks for y'alls help 
07:05:34 <MorgiePie> Also, grey skinned humanoids 
07:05:36 <Bunton> Be warned you might have to bounce a good few ideas off before you hit that gem that'll make a brilliant first article.
07:05:51 <MorgiePie> They appear in so many reg creepypastas and such
07:05:57 <MorgiePie> What's with grey skin?
07:06:25 * PeppersGhost shrugs
07:06:44 <PeppersGhost> And yes, you'll definitely have a better time if you for the right concept to come along
07:06:51 <PeppersGhost> * if you wait 
07:06:52 <Bunton> It's just a standard trope. People want to tap into the uncanny valley effect, so they just think "grek skin, sharp teeth... uh..."
07:07:07 <MorgiePie> I should write a creepypasta where the narrator finds a creature with disgusting, pink skinned freak that's overly muscled
07:07:10 <Bunton> "Too many arms, that's a good one."
07:07:12 <PeppersGhost> Humanoids with grey skin and sharp teeth are scary
07:07:17 <PeppersGhost> … the first dozen times or so
07:07:26 <MorgiePie> And the narrator turns out to be a gaunt, grey skinned humanoid
07:07:29 <PeppersGhost> we are a jaded bunch here. 
07:07:32 <Bunton> It's not so much that it actually scares the writer as it is just really easy to think of.
07:07:43 <PeppersGhost> "No, John, you are the grey-skinned humanoid."
07:07:47 <Bunton> It's hard to be scared by your own creation.
07:07:55 <PeppersGhost> And then John was grey-skinned humanoid.
07:08:09 <Bunton> So people sometimes think something that isn't scary to them will still be scary to others.
07:08:16 <Bunton> Genuine scary is hard to write.
07:08:18 <MorgiePie> They're like creepypastas version of the zombie
07:08:22 <PeppersGhost> "I should write a creepypasta where the narrator finds a creature with disgusting, pink skinned freak that's overly muscled"
07:08:26 <PeppersGhost> That actually sounds like a hilarious idea
07:08:32 <Bunton> It helps if you understand what makes proper scary stories scary.
07:08:38 <PeppersGhost> That could even work as an SCP, maybe???
07:08:43 <Bunton> Peppers: mmmmm.
07:08:44 <Soulless> going to be
07:08:45 <Soulless> bed
07:08:49 <Soulless> see you all on the other side
07:08:55 <Bunton> Maybe not for yer first, but it could work.
07:08:56 <Bunton> Maybe.
07:09:01 <PeppersGhost> Standard emaciated grey-skinned monstrosity, but totally sentient and sees normal peeps as boogidy-boos
07:09:05 <PeppersGhost> G'night Soulless!

07:09:31 <Bunton> Try going through creepypasta or scips and finding one that gives you the willies.
07:09:40 <Bunton> And then ask yourself "why does this frighten me?"
07:09:48 <MorgiePie> Imprisoned by a bunch of the freaks who keep other innocent grey skins in a sadistic hell-lab. 
07:09:52 <MorgiePie> Hmm
07:09:56 <Bunton> "Is there a particular phrase or sentence that scared me?"
07:10:03 <MorgiePie> I always really hated (in a good way) "barbie.avi" 
07:10:06 <Bunton> "At what part was I frightened, and why did that part frighten me?"
07:10:15 <Bunton> Try re-reading it and doing some analysis.
07:10:28 <MorgiePie> Because the way the writer describes the interview with the woman, and the sentence 'the plastic tarp was cleaned' 
07:10:28 <Bunton> It'll help, I promise.
07:10:44 <MorgiePie> Well, that sentence was badly parapharsed 
07:10:45 <Bunton> Yeah. Once you've identified that, you can extrapolate it.
07:10:50 <Bunton> And use it elsewhere.
07:10:50 <MorgiePie> But ya get the idea
07:11:14 <Bunton> Which isn't plagiarism, since you're extracting individual elements and techniques rather than big concepts.
07:11:38 <MorgiePie> I remember when I was little fella and first read 'white with red'

07:12:49 <Bunton> Nah, no worries.

07:12:53 <Bunton> You can go to bed if you want.

07:14:21 <MorgiePie> Trying to get a part time job 
07:14:32 <MorgiePie> I've applied to a few places, but you know how it is

07:15:27 <MorgiePie> Just dropped off an app to a pet store
07:15:38 <MorgiePie> Cleaning rabbit shit for minimum wage, yay
07:15:55 <Bunton> I'm trying to apply to pretty much the same job for nothing.
07:15:56 <Bunton> :p
07:16:14 <MorgiePie> Volunteer work?
07:16:22 <Bunton> Yeah.
07:16:37 <Bunton> Need to pad out me CV.
07:16:41 <MorgiePie> Well, at least they don't have dogs or cats

07:28:35 <JConwell> Or at least that is what they want us to believe... >_>
07:28:48 <Korppi> Yikes, that little thing that happened must be part of a larger behind the scenes thing
07:28:53 <Korppi> *shrug*
07:28:58 <Korppi> none of my business

07:31:05 <Korppi> People's answers to this question have been bugging me
07:31:29 <lfairy> both
07:31:35 <lfairy> seriously
07:31:38 <Korppi> :I 
07:31:45 <Randomini> instrument
07:31:48 <lfairy> that person's holding the things out there
07:32:02 <lfairy> can't you just grab 'em?
07:32:13 <Korppi> That's not the point :I
07:32:41 <Korppi> I've seen a majority go for the blue
07:32:46 <Korppi> Which honestly surprised me
07:32:54 <lfairy> well, I'm in creative mode right now, not following-rules mode :V
07:33:06 <Korppi> I feel like speaking /every/ language is a bit more useful
07:33:18 <Korppi> Especially since it doesn't say "Earth" languages
07:33:32 <lfairy> I probably should switch back before coding again
07:33:47 <Randomini> it also doesn't specify "instrument"
07:33:53 <Randomini> guns are instruments of warfare
07:33:57 <Korppi> I..
07:34:01 <Korppi> I didn't think of that
07:34:01 <Randomini> swords, too
07:34:13 <Randomini> pretty much everything is an instrument
07:34:20 <Randomini> scissors are instruments for cutting
07:34:23 <lfairy> brains are instruments... of thought?
07:34:29 <Randomini> congratulations, you are a master hairdresser
07:34:49 <Korppi> However, the majority of people who answered blue were talking about music. So I'm still surprised
07:35:55 <Randomini> music is a more marketable skill
07:36:29 <Randomini> also, fluency isn't the same as genuine comprehension
07:36:39 <Randomini> I know a lot of people who are nominally fluent in english
07:36:49 <Randomini> but don't understand proper sentence structure
07:36:50 <lfairy> I guess Randomini has a point. One billion people speak Chinese
07:37:00 <Randomini> also, you can't write in those languages, just speak
07:37:07 <Randomini> so you can't even read imported books
07:37:12 <Korppi> Well now you're just totally picking apart the post. This isn't worded great
07:37:17 <Korppi> I suppose.
07:37:25 <Cain> Aren't languages instruments of communication?
07:37:34 <Cain> Take the blue pill.
07:37:38 <Korppi> I guess the Sci-Fi fan part of me took over
07:37:39 <Cain> You get to be God.
07:38:11 <Korppi> I'm acting like aliens will definetly show up in my lifetime XD
07:38:51 <Randomini> Korppi, the big assumption you're making
07:38:58 <Randomini> is that the aliens will have spoken languages.
07:39:06 <Korppi> Touche 
07:39:25 <Randomini> it's quite possible they communicate via bioluminescence or something
07:39:30 <Cain> Oh, yeah, it does stipulate Spoken.
07:39:38 <Korppi> "a thing used in pursuing an aim or policy; a means."
07:39:43 <Korppi> Oh my god
07:39:53 <Korppi> the blue pill really would make you god
07:39:58 <Randomini> instruments are /literally every thing/
07:40:05 <Randomini> anything you can use
07:40:08 <Randomini> you are a master at
07:40:31 <Cain> As long as you can define your purpose.
07:41:03 <Cain> If you're just masturbating in public for the hell of it you're not going anywhere different.
07:41:19 <Randomini> my hand is an instrument baby
07:41:23 <lfairy> You don't get the disadvantages of being a god either
07:41:28 <Cain> But if you're using masturbating in public as an instrument to creep people out, you're gonna get shit done.
07:41:33 <lfairy> since mastering your own mind gives you self-control and motivation
07:41:59 <Piefish> Woah woah woah
07:42:02 <Korppi> So by the broad definition of "instrument".... you could learn any language you need to if it's a means to an end
07:42:07 <Piefish> Let's stop the masturbating in public topic pls?
07:42:24 <Randomini> sorry, couldn't hear you piefish

07:46:06 <Piefish> And tbh it's not that much BS, I could actually use a lot of the people skills I have :P
07:46:34 <Bunton> You have to get management experience from somewhere, so deputy manager seems a good place for people to start.
07:46:46 <Bunton> You can't really do management volunteer work, after all.

07:59:04 <Piefish> Let's have the player go through the same room 10000 times cause level design is boring
07:59:12 <Korppi> I mean like, videos where people took bits of video and put them to a song
07:59:14 <Piefish> OST and reach were the only ones I liked
07:59:20 <Piefish> ODST*
07:59:40 <Korppi> And I disagree on the gameplay front, but I'm to sleepy to debate
08:00:00 <Piefish> Ehhh, I think it's pretty samey but meh :P
08:00:09 <Korppi> Opinions
08:00:12 <Korppi> Yaay
08:00:20 <Piefish> I keep playing Wolfenstein: The New order lately
08:00:21 <Dexanote> Cain: omg
08:00:23 <Piefish> is such a good game
08:00:24 <Dexanote> Obsolote Man
08:00:31 <Dexanote> Great episode
08:00:36 <Piefish> Apart from one flaw which I ended up writing a tumblr post aboot
08:00:38 <Korppi> You want to know what makes me sound like a console pleb
08:00:49 <Korppi> Halo is literally my favorite FPS franchise
08:00:56 <Korppi> But I'm primarily a PC gamer
08:01:02 <Cain> Dexanote: Right?
08:01:06 <Piefish> ./kick Korppi Dirty console peasant
08:01:10 <Piefish> :P
08:01:24 <Dexanote> its so good
08:01:43 <Dexanote> i have the whole series on my hd
08:02:33 <Korppi> I'm also super hyped for Destiny. 
08:02:45 <Piefish> Ehhh 
08:02:47 <Korppi> Bungie back at Sci-Fi worldbuilding
08:02:48 <Piefish> I wish it was on PC
08:02:51 <Korppi> hnnnng
08:03:00 <Piefish> And tbh I'm not overly keen on it
08:03:05 <Korppi> I do to. But I can live *shrug*
08:03:09 <Korppi> I /loved/ the Alpha
08:03:10 <Piefish> I can't :(
08:03:25 <Piefish> I only has PC now (well I have a 360 but I cba to connect it up
08:03:32 <Korppi> Well it's over so obviously :P
08:03:49 <Korppi> I have a PS4 and PS3
08:03:55 <Crayne> Piefish, ever played Frozen Synapse?
08:03:58 <Korppi> the 360 is packed in a box
08:04:00 <Piefish> nup
08:04:04 <Korppi> Wanting to be sold
08:04:10 <Crayne> sCool. Just so you know. :P
08:04:13 <Crayne> .y frozen synapse
08:04:19 <Korppi> That's my internal struggle.

08:06:01 <Korppi> Oh man that old opening
08:06:48 <Korppi> It's older than the old opening I usually think of 
08:07:42 <PeppersGhost> Does anyone happen to have that one fuel image of the guy surrounded by floating mail?
08:07:51 <Korppi> Man, I just hope Frederic shows up in Halo 5
08:08:10 <Randomini> so I just solved a narrative problem
08:08:19 <Randomini> simply by writing the following sentence
08:08:21 <Randomini> "Turn on, tune in, drop out, toke up, jack off, you know?"
08:08:40 <Piefish> What
08:08:54 <Randomini> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out
08:09:21 <Piefish> Again what
08:09:23 <Randomini> basically, I'm crossing the GOIs a lot earlier than I was expecting
08:09:27 <Randomini> it also makes the narrative flow a lot smoother, too
08:09:29 <Korppi> I should also probably go and watch all the Spartan Ops cutscenes. Since  I sold all my 360 games before it finished.
08:10:04 <Piefish> Omg
08:10:11 <Piefish> I watched the transformers animated film
08:10:14 <Piefish> this weekend
08:10:24 <Piefish> It was so bizarre
08:10:41 <Piefish> And was way better than anything michael bay could do
08:10:50 <Korppi> I almost said "which one" but then I realized it was obviously /the/ Transformer movie 
08:10:56 <Piefish> Yup
08:11:00 <PeppersGhost> Found it
08:11:01 <PeppersGhost> https://38.media.tumblr.com/8f9d0925986a68b16547256520a5c0df/tumblr_mxbjgpZRO41save0go3_1280.jpg
08:11:02 <Piefish> Dem retro sci fi sounds
08:11:06 <Korppi> You've got the touch! 
08:11:19 <Piefish> Oh yes
08:11:28 <Piefish> There was one thing though
08:11:42 <Piefish> Spike at one point goes "Oh shit! What are we gonna do now?"
08:11:56 <Piefish> I had to listen to that part again to confirm he says "oh shit"
08:12:13 <Piefish> Apparently the 80's was a time when saying "Oh shit!" in a kids film was acceptable
08:12:35 <Korppi> Baha
08:13:37 <Piefish> There was also this bit with these transformers that weren't transformers cause they could only turn into bikes and spoke in a weird Australian accent and the transformers and the aussies became friends and started dancing in a circle
08:13:48 <Piefish> At that point I think the writers just got a bit high
08:14:38 <Piefish> If Michael Bay had basically just remade the old transformers cartoons, following the same plot, the transformers films would be way better
08:15:07 <Piefish> I'm still super pissed that the new film just kinda glosses over the unicron plot
08:15:58 <Piefish> Actually it doesn't even gloss over it, it fucks it in the ass and doesn't have the courtesy to give it a reach around (full metal jacket sort of quote)
08:17:26 <Korppi> Have you watched Transformers Prime?
08:18:03 <Korppi> It's 2 seasons and a movie. I've only watched the first season, but I liked it
08:18:52 <Piefish> nuup

08:25:10 * Piefish does not remember this
08:25:29 <Korppi> It's in Spartan Ops in Halo 4. 
08:25:56 <Korppi> The cutscene for Episode 1 
08:27:11 <Piefish> Does spartan ops give some clue as to what the fuck was going on in halo 4?
08:27:59 <Korppi> Err
08:28:01 <Korppi> I mean
08:28:34 <Randomini> so I just wrote the worst joke
08:28:39 <Korppi> It's more expanded stuff 6 months later. I haven't seen all of it, which is why I'm watching it now
08:28:41 <Randomini> is anyone from the Broken God team on right now?
08:29:01 <Randomini> I made a terrible, terrible joke and I want to run it past them for narrative consistency
08:29:07 <Korppi> I already understood Halo 4, but it kind of fucks over people who don't know all the expanded lore of Halo
08:30:32 <Korppi> But I'm also the guy who has an $85 Halo 4 action figure :I 
08:31:31 <Piefish> Eh i've spent £500+ on TF2 hats
08:31:46 <Piefish> Also I has valve action figures and a portal gun
08:31:50 <Piefish> as well as other stuff
08:34:22 <Korppi> I love how much everyone hates Doctor Hallsy in this

09:06:52 <Korppi> I've got about 10 minutes left on this, but then I will
09:07:01 <Kidd> Why are the brackets needed?
09:07:18 <Piefish> Cause that's for the make/model
09:07:24 <Kidd> Ah
09:07:31 <Piefish> Anything in square brackets is something that will be changed
09:07:37 <Piefish> I just haven't figured out what to yet

09:10:33 <Piefish> lemme add that in
09:10:46 <Kidd> Ok
09:13:13 <Kidd> Piefish: you have a bunch of missing commas in the interviews
09:13:52 <Piefish> Where?
09:15:04 <Kidd> Well I wouldn't say I know them well but they always say hello to me and wave to me and such.
09:15:29 <Kidd> Comma before but and before and
09:16:06 <Korppi> That was an hour of awesome
09:16:16 <Korppi> Okay more like 50 minutes but still
09:16:17 <Kidd>  Sorry did you say they wave at you?
09:16:28 <Kidd> Need a comma before did
09:16:39 <Kidd> Korppi what did you do?
09:16:41 <lfairy> What happened Korppi?
09:17:17 <Korppi> Oh, I was watching a video that put all the Spartan Ops cutscenes from Halo 4 into one video
09:17:32 <Korppi> Because I got rid of my Xbox before all the episodes were out
09:17:35 <Kidd> Piefish: They aren't in trouble are they?
09:17:42 <Kidd> Comma before are
09:17:53 <Kidd> And everything I said above 
09:17:59 <Piefish> Kidd: both "but" and "and" are connectives, why o they need commas before them?
09:18:14 <Piefish> other two things changing
09:18:41 <chubert> hey, korppi
09:18:48 <chubert> can you check out a contest tale draft at the moment?
09:19:01 <Korppi> okay, I guess
09:19:09 <chubert> http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net/chubert
09:19:12 <chubert> second-to-last tab
09:19:47 <Kidd> Piefish: ok, no comma on and
09:20:03 <Kidd> But the sentence with but is a compound sentence 
09:20:26 <Kidd> So you need a comma for the conjunction

09:21:53 <chubert> just using the terminology from the wanderery's library :p

09:23:03 <Kidd> Piefish: Well of course if they were actually bulldozers I'd be surprised but they're not actually bulldozers.
09:23:12 <Kidd> Comma before but

09:28:02 <Kidd> Piefish: the second interview seems unnecessary 
09:28:35 <Korppi> I do find it funny that you and TG have fumbling agents/soldiers of the CI. Yet I for some reason thought they would be more professional. 
09:28:51 <chubert> TG has that?
09:29:12 <chubert> well, either way
09:29:26 <chubert> i would figure that the CI is capable of fielding soldiers of equal quality to the foundation

09:29:36 <chubert> they just have a ton of conscripted, untrained alpas to use as cannon fodder :p
09:29:44 <Korppi> Well not fumbling, just unproffesional. But to be fair she herself was anomalous and the whole story takes place after the assignment

10:21:26 <Athena_Grey>  /every/ item we have is explicitly anomalous in some way
10:22:22 <Athena_Grey> isn't that supposed to at least ping people's Suspension of Disbelief alarm?
10:22:52 <GoldenDragon> I ask because was thinking of having my SCP's containment cell built with a thin layer of telekill alloy sandwiched between the standard material
10:23:08 <Athena_Grey> ooh Telekill
10:23:21 <Athena_Grey> that's one of my fave element of Classic SCP, actually XD
10:23:37 <GoldenDragon> though now that I think about it that seems a little overboard for an SCP that can invade someone's memories
10:23:43 <FlameShirt> why do people believe that a story featuring torture-deaths of thieves and minor rabble-rousers are stories of moral paragoninity? 
10:23:54 <FlameShirt> because people are silly billies
10:25:05 <FlameShirt> also, paragoninity is totally a real word i didn't make up
10:25:39 <Athena_Grey> paragoninity 
10:25:52 <Athena_Grey> FlameShirt my autocorrect disagrees :P
10:26:08 <FlameShirt> autocorrect can do one

10:36:58 <EdAWACS> how is everyone doing today?
10:37:06 <Gujzo> Just woke up
10:37:11 <Gujzo> Extremely tired

10:37:37 <EdAWACS> oh hello gujzo are you new?
10:37:55 <EdAWACS> that looks lovely thegreekowl did you draw that?
10:38:06 <Gujzo> TheGreekOwl: verily
10:38:33 <Gujzo> I joined the Foundation couple of days ago but made my impression in the chat
10:38:56 <EdAWACS> I see gujzo
10:38:58 <EdAWACS> that
10:39:03 <EdAWACS> 's nice
10:39:24 <TheGreekOwl> EdAWACS: No, I paint better then that
10:39:51 <EdAWACS> I see thegreekowl that's nice
10:40:06 <Athena_Grey> is everyone also working on their Contest entry?
10:40:27 * EdAWACS raises his hand
10:40:36 <EdAWACS> I'm doing scp-1853
10:41:04 <Athena_Grey> I think I may do a write-up on SCP-961
10:41:20 <EdAWACS> scp-961
10:41:44 <Athena_Grey> if only because that damn sundial kinda ruined our vision on what Alexylva is like, and we'd better find some Clever Retcon somehow
10:41:52 <Athena_Grey> also
10:41:57 <EdAWACS> ?
10:42:01 <Athena_Grey> .y hunger games catching fire trailer
10:42:15 <Gujzo> I dont like the movies
10:42:15 <Athena_Grey> wait no wrong one
10:42:27 <EdAWACS> wait look at this one 
10:42:29 <EdAWACS> http://9gag.com/gag/aWZrOo4?ref=fbp

10:43:21 <Athena_Grey> .y the hunger games mockingjay teaser
10:43:23 <Athena_Grey> ^^ that
10:43:25 <Gujzo> Whats funny is is that there is no garuntee the star will go supernova :3
10:43:32 <EdAWACS> yeah
10:43:36 <EdAWACS> I know right?
10:43:58 <EdAWACS> welp going to play me some notd 
10:44:11 <Gujzo> Also, the only reason the movie should be split into two parts is if they include EVERY single word straight to the script
10:44:49 <Gujzo> Im pretty critical about book-to-movie deals
10:45:01 <PeppersGhost> Given how weak the third book was, I'm hoping that they'll use the extra time to fix the pacing issues
10:45:42 <Gujzo> PeppersGhost let's just hope they get freaking District 13 right
10:45:52 <EdAWACS> hello peppersghost!
10:45:55 <Athena_Grey> I have not read the second or third book
10:46:02 <PeppersGhost> They've been pretty good about getting all the important stuff right in the first two movies
10:46:03 <Athena_Grey> or since any movie beyond the first
10:46:07 <PeppersGhost> Heya Ed
10:46:13 <Athena_Grey> I just linked it because it looks like a good teaser
10:46:14 <Gujzo> Don't worry Athena I won't spoil ot for you

11:05:12 <EdAWACS> I personally liked the game
11:05:13 <Gujzo> Its pretty much gta with hacking
11:05:25 <EdAWACS> the reason I'm hooked was this page
11:05:28 <EdAWACS> .g ctos
11:05:45 <EdAWACS> I liked the story
11:05:53 <Piefish> I didn't
11:06:00 <EdAWACS> that's okay...
11:06:09 <Piefish> The protagonist is a vigilante that is also a criminal
11:06:19 <Piefish> So he goes after people doing pretty much the same things he's doing
11:06:23 * EdAWACS shrugs
11:06:29 <Piefish> makes it kinda hard to like a guy that is a criminal himself
11:06:42 <Piefish> Like he's super hypocritical

11:29:30 <Gujzo> Reach cant get into them
11:29:43 <Reach> Alexandra, u r disappoint

11:30:47 <Eskobear> i could never understand why someone needed a chatbot
11:30:49 <Reach> .mtg silver myr
11:30:53 <Eskobear> for a chatroom that isn't MTG related at all
11:30:58 <Eskobear> for MTG search
11:31:01 <Reach> Eskobear: Right, but it is fun!
11:31:11 <Reach> And slow, since there are a bunch of cards.
11:31:31 <Reach> Ah, Eskobear, in your opinion, what is better? Three short tales or one long tale?
11:31:48 <Eskobear> I dunno, some of the grapebots have MTG search, but this is a skybot.
11:31:58 <Eskobear> uh, depends on the actual content of each 
11:32:11 <Sophos> Eskobear: They have .mtg because the official repo comes with it
11:32:19 <Eskobear> if you only have one tale's worth of material, splitting it into three tales is gonna seem like page spammy
11:32:30 <Sophos> You're not George Lucas
11:32:36 <Sophos> There's no reason for you split your thing into three
11:33:39 <Reach> Eskobear, Sophos: It has three scenes happening the same environment, and I've been told it is unwieldy for site standards. I don't even know how long is "long" for a typical SCP tale.
11:33:59 <Eskobear> that being said, if you actually have three tales worth of material, combining it into one can get unwieldy 
11:34:05 <Eskobear> can you just, like, link them?
11:34:17 <Reach> What, link you the draft?
11:34:21 <Eskobear> yeah
11:34:23 <Eskobear> i can glance at it
11:34:42 <Reach> Well, okay. It's a GoI contest entry, though.

11:35:06 <Len> Hello, Reach.
11:35:11 <Len> Why are you in trouble?
11:35:13 <Gujzo> Also I want another opinion on my scp draft. I'll wait until your tale is evaliated though
11:35:16 <Reach> http://borradores-scp-es.wikidot.com/experimental-2-no-tocar-> tab Tale 2. 
11:35:17 <Eskobear> Yeah, no, you're good.
11:35:23 <Deimos> Sup Len
11:35:27 <GoldenDragon> Kay added a short start to my pages description
11:35:34 <Reach> Len: Not in trouble really really. Gujzo: sorryyyy :(
11:35:44 <Gujzo> Its fone
11:35:47 <Gujzo> Fine*
11:36:05 <Eskobear> okay
11:36:18 <Len> Greetings, Deimos.

11:36:27 <Eskobear> i can say that, /without having read it/, the sheer length of the document looks like at least two tales worth
11:36:47 <Deimos> He sent me a postcard from Universe-G214-something or other can't remember.
11:36:53 <Len> :3
11:36:56 * PeppersGhost takes a deep breath
11:37:03 <PeppersGhost> Ooookay. Almost done with this skip.
11:37:04 <Reach> Eskobear: Been told that. Cutting it in two will leave one much longer than the other, though.
11:37:05 <Eskobear> now, I can't say if the suggestion instead should be that you should just, y'know, shorten it
11:37:06 <PeppersGhost> You can do this, Pepper
11:37:16 <Reach> Eskobear: Tried. Failed.

11:39:09 <Len> I am starting to think that a skip I'm working on is too long
11:39:25 <Len> I might create the interview log as a separate page, but I don't really want to.
11:39:40 <Silber> >open a chest
11:39:54 <Gujzo> Let me double check to see my SCP title isnt taken
11:39:56 <Reach> Eskobear: Thanks for your insight. I'll try to shorten it/them tale/s) further.

11:41:26 <Piefish> Second
11:41:27 <Piefish> secure locker only accessible by a keypad lock. Any form of ink is to be kept away from SCP-XXXX-1 to prevent its effects. The code to this keypad is known by senior researchers on-site and shold only be changed every two weeks should only be known by the on-site director and be changed every two months.
11:41:38 <Piefish> The sentence in the middle is unrelated to the sentences around it

11:41:49 <Piefish> keeping the ink away should be after the sentences about the keypad
11:42:03 <PeppersGhost> ?
11:42:07 <Len> Just wondering, why did you use SCP-RRRR in your draft? XD
11:42:08 <Gujzo> Alright
11:42:13 <Len> Most people use "XXXX"
11:42:23 <Len> Or sometimes "####"
11:42:27 <PeppersGhost> Because I don't play by the ruuuules

11:43:44 <outofReach> :3
11:43:46 <Crayne> GoldenDragon: there's nothing much to critique. I will say that your containment procedures aren't /special/ containment procedures.
11:43:57 <Piefish> the font written by SCP-XXXX-1 is Times New Roman
11:44:01 <Piefish> ehhhhhh
11:44:10 <Piefish> Why is it writing in MS Office fonts?
11:44:18 <Crayne> Also, please don't randomly blurt repeated nonsense like 'boooop'. If you want to tell us something, by all means do so.
11:44:26 <Gujzo> Well the pen has the ability to accuratly depict typing fonts
11:44:27 <Crayne> Hey Reach.
11:44:30 <Gujzo> I should put that in
11:44:51 <Piefish> Ok that seems kinda random
11:45:06 <Gujzo> Well its supposed to be an innaccuracy
11:45:16 <Gujzo> Since Indias main government font is Manga
11:45:20 <Gujzo> Magal*

11:49:28 <GoldenDragon> c:
11:49:35 <Sophos> [Insert #NIGHTOFTHEFREEIPAD joke here]
11:49:36 <Gujzo> Ill edit mine to
11:49:43 <GoldenDragon> hope it's more super special now
11:50:08 <Piefish> Gujzo: a pen writing in a computer font just seems a bit strange to me and not the good strange, it just seems kinda random
11:50:40 <Gujzo> Piefish well it adds to the anomolous properties
11:50:52 <Gujzo> Hand writing a decleration of war isnt very beleivable
11:51:31 <Piefish> Neither is a pen that writes by itself
11:51:36 <HERIC> well atleast it is a relatively common font. it could be the typeface used by Hagelin C-36
11:51:50 <Piefish> I just feel it would add some mystery to it as if it's an entity writing it
11:51:56 <HERIC> an ancient fully mechanical crypto device from sweden
11:52:41 <Piefish> Anyway the idea itself is ok but I doubt I'd upvote it, there's not enough there
11:53:13 <Gujzo> Well i had to retype it and edit it multiple times so a lot is left out
11:53:19 <Gujzo> Also
11:53:37 <Gujzo> Is it alright to say that the writer has the ability to write in these fonts
11:53:56 <Gujzo> Although there is no understanding of how it is able to accuratly write these
11:54:02 <Piefish> Well it's your scip
11:54:06 <Piefish> You can say what you want
11:54:22 <Piefish> but my suspension od disbelief stops at the fact someone can write in perfect times new roman
11:54:50 <Gujzo> I'll try and change the font type to something more resembling hand writing
11:55:03 <Gujzo> NOT COMIC SANS though
11:55:06 <Gujzo> Im not an idiot
11:55:14 <Piefish> comic sans
11:55:16 <Piefish> COMIC SANS
11:55:21 <Piefish> MUCH COMIC SANS
11:55:24 <Piefish> MANY HANDWRITING
11:55:26 <Gujzo> NUH
11:55:33 <outofReach> Let me stop you right there. 
11:55:34 <Piefish> SUCH AUTHENTICITY 
11:55:40 <Piefish> SO WOW
11:55:53 <outofReach> Comic Sans is not that horribly. This meme has gone for so long it's getting annoying. Too. 
11:55:58 <outofReach> horrible*
11:56:32 <outofReach> Comic Sans is not good, but it's not "I'm not an idiot because I've discarded Comic Sans."
11:56:57 * outofReach goes back into lurking.
11:56:58 <Piefish> such discussion
11:57:01 <Piefish> many comic sans
11:57:11 <Piefish> where outofReach go?
11:57:16 <Piefish> will come back?
11:58:11 <Gujzo> So i found a hand writing font in ms word
