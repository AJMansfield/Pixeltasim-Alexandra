00:49:19 <FlameShirt> is this a serious question
00:49:19 <Kestin> I was gonna say

00:49:34 <Nemi> i never got drunk until 20 but i'm boring
00:49:35 <Kestin> Not all 16-year-olds are as law-abiding :P
00:49:35 <Vince> so guys, what are some of your favorite low-rated articles/tales? 
00:49:36 <Gujzo> Seriously though I dont wanna drink
00:49:42 <Vorcha> teaflower I know a 16 old who got drunk while pregnant, sucked a dick for cocaine, and then snorted said coke off of said dick
00:49:44 <Vorcha> all in the same night
00:49:47 <RobWatson> drinking is fun
00:49:48 <Kestin> What's the threshold for "low-rated"?
00:49:49 <Vorcha> she wasn't even 16 at the time
00:49:49 <teaflower> wow

00:50:47 <Vorcha> until I smoked a cigarette a few times
00:50:51 <Vorcha> because of stress from an ex
00:50:52 <TheRaven> I'm 20 and haven't even tried drinking
00:50:54 <teaflower> there's rarely alcohol in my house

00:51:03 <teaflower> twenty+ years sober
00:51:13 <teaflower> but the way she puts it is just one drink is too much
00:51:20 <Gujzo> RobWatson who cares at least it means I eat food
00:51:22 <Kestin> Maybe for her it is
00:51:22 <Vorcha> My liver is already shit
00:51:28 <Vorcha> I was born with bad kidneys and liver
00:51:39 <RobWatson> oh
00:52:04 <Kestin> Well, if we have to have a concrete reason not to do it, then I volunteer my lack of verbal filter even when sober. Imagine how awful I'd be drunk

01:15:21 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1: The problem is that you need more than an effect to make a good article.
01:15:27 * Roget knows all his rewrite precursors
01:15:32 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  You need to tell some interesting story.
01:15:35 <Kestin> We can give you feedback on a draft, but we can't write it for you
01:15:37 <Mrtdark1> @Nighkos I am aware.
01:15:56 <Roget> thedeadlymoose, he popped back in about... I want to say a year ago? He tried to edit it. But he didn't add much. I axed it when I re-added the part you liked.
01:15:57 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin I'm not asking for that
01:16:25 <Mrtdark1> Here's what I have for the Brother-making mechanics:
01:16:29 <Nighkos> I'm of the mindset that almsot any effect can be made interesting depending on how you approach it.
01:16:35 <Kestin> Well, you're asking for help coming up with the main idea of the piece, right? I think that's gotta be your territory
01:16:50 <Nighkos> So, I feel that you may be comming at this from the wrong direction.
01:16:52 <Mrtdark1> 1. If you have a sibling, it replaces you
01:16:56 <Kestin> (Don't take my word as law though)

01:17:51 <Mrtdark1> 2. If you do not it A) creates one, or B) replaces you depending on a boy or girl
01:17:51 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  I suppose with an effect like that, you could tell a story about the true meaning of family

01:18:55 <teaflower> do yourself a favor, everyone
01:18:56 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  But the thing is, it's probably better to think of the story you want to tell /first/, and then think about your object effect /second/.
01:18:59 <teaflower> do not bite yourself

01:19:07 <Kestin> Oh, have you featured that fan video about me yet? It's really good
01:19:08 <Dr_Kens> teaflower: That's some good advice.
01:19:30 <Mrtdark1> Ah. Most of the decent ideas I have are generic monsters
01:19:42 <Mrtdark1> Aside from this one:
01:19:46 <Kestin> (Okay, fine, by "me" I mean the goddamn toaster)
01:20:15 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1: Just because you don't know much doesn't necessarily mean that you can't write about it.  You're perspective can still be an interesting one.  I'd say if you're worried about it, do some research on what others have done with a similar topic.
01:20:49 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1:  Also, like Kestin, I'd like to give you the disclamer that I am also still very inexperienced at this whole SCP thing.
01:20:57 <Nighkos> Mrtdark1: So don't take my word as gospel.
01:21:37 <TwistedGears> My word, however, is holy.

01:40:52 <Dexanote> hrm
01:40:55 <Faminepulse> fuck you bot
01:40:57 <Mrtdark1> Instead of the baby being the focus, it's the parent
01:40:59 <Dexanote> whoa famine
01:41:03 <Dexanote> its still under construction
01:41:06 <Kestin> Yeah, give her some time to get to know the site, eh?
01:41:08 <Soulless> Faminepulse: It's still WIP
01:41:09 <Soulless> calm down
01:41:12 <Faminepulse> Dexanote, im stress testing it

01:42:47 <tahugamin> Mrtdark1: ...?
01:43:11 <Mrtdark1> The kid isn't the source of the Sad Daddy
01:43:18 * Pendragon jump kicks Riemann for no particular reason.
01:43:23 <Mrtdark1> The original dad is
01:43:30 <Riemann> the sadness is the source
01:43:36 <Kestin> Sounds like a human version of the soup bowl
01:43:40 <Kestin> Kinda
01:43:50 <Mrtdark1> @Riemann surpisingly yes
01:44:21 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin not really
01:44:30 <Mrtdark1> It doesn't affect other people
01:44:40 <Mrtdark1> And it isn't humanoid
01:44:48 <Kestin> Doesn't mean it can't remind me of another skip
01:44:55 <Kestin> Even if it isn't exactly the same
01:44:56 <Mrtdark1> It's shaped like a couch
01:45:01 <Kestin> (This isn't feedback, it's just a comment)
01:45:08 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin that's true
01:45:37 <Kestin> How can it be both humanoid and shaped like a couch?
01:45:51 <Mrtdark1> It's made from a person
01:45:53 <Pendragon> It's a man couch.
01:46:04 <Pendragon> Also, you better be using the picture I think you're using.
01:46:09 <Kestin> So how does its anomaly manifest?
01:46:20 <Mrtdark1> @pendragon yes and what picture
01:46:37 <Mrtdark1> @Kestin that's the problem
01:46:53 <Mrtdark1> I don't have that mapped out yet
01:46:58 <Pendragon> There's a chair cut in half that looks like there's meat inside.
01:47:23 <Mrtdark1> @pendragon nah

01:47:49 <Soulless> You all might too
01:47:55 <Kestin> So the guy magically became a couch, or was killed and made into a couch?
01:48:09 <Soulless> "So when you are asked, What does the character want? what your workshop means is, Your story is boring.

01:49:21 <Kestin> Why a couch, though?
01:49:29 <tahugamin> .y be a dentist
01:49:30 <Soulless> tahugamin: ahahhaha

01:49:36 <Kestin> It would make sense if it had something to do with the effect, but you don't have an effect yet

01:50:12 <Soulless> tahugamin: Sometimes when people say show, dont tell, what they mean is that they find the characters sympathetic, the story is moving forward, and they even like the conflict, but they just dont like the way you wrote it.
01:50:14 <Soulless> ahahahahhahaha
01:50:19 <thedeadlymoose> Roget: hahahahahaha
01:50:29 <Pendragon> All dem laughes.

01:50:46 <thedeadlymoose> Roget: hahahahaha
01:50:50 <Roget> and that he had go to home to his mom because the streetlights were on
01:50:51 <Riemann> but there's so much teeeeeeext

02:42:01 <Pendragon> DrYucatan depending on where Smapti lives in japan, Baka could be a serious insult.
02:42:04 <tahunu> DrYucatan: Just blame freddo :V
02:42:10 <Pendragon> Just pointing that out.

02:54:46 <Voct> Pendragon - that can be arranged.
02:54:48 <Voct> for real.
02:55:01 <Voct> it'll cost us a lot of money, but it can seriously be arranged.
02:55:33 <Pendragon> I would sell my solid gold humvee for that.
02:56:39 <DrYucatan> I would kill the President of Kiribati for that.
02:56:49 <DrYucatan> Anote Tong, I'm coming for you, you Pacific motherfucker.
02:56:53 <Voct> in the words of robert pattinson, when he was asked why he took a role in the Twilight movies even though he was going on the record as hating the Twilight novels:
02:56:58 <Voct> "I'm an actor. We're whores."
02:57:10 <Pendragon> He was in a twilight movie?
02:57:25 <Voct> yes, he played the sparkly vampire Edgar.
02:57:57 <Voct> also, on a more serious note
02:58:18 <DrYucatan> Edward, Voct.
02:58:31 <DrYucatan> Not Edgar.
02:58:37 <Voct> DrYucatan, I strongly advise that you not make further death threats against heads of state. That could get you put in prison.
02:58:56 <Pendragon> I need to watch the iron giant.
02:59:07 <Voct> even if it's just the head of state of kiribati
02:59:18 <Pendragon> Where the hell is Kiribati?
02:59:21 <DrYucatan> Voct, you're probably right.
02:59:27 <Voct> Pendragon - pacific ocean
02:59:44 <Voct> DrYucatan - I strongly recommend that you openly retract your death threat against Anote Tong.
02:59:44 <Pendragon> Ah, an island country.

04:10:25 <Dr_Kens> You'll love Alexandra.
04:10:25 <Dr_Kens> Oh yes.
04:10:54 <Pendragon> I still want to make a story where Nala takes over Site 19, and all of us have to shut it down.
04:11:05 <thedeadlymoose> Pendragon: It really was.
04:11:41 <thedeadlymoose> teaflower: watching
04:12:09 <Pendragon> So am I.
04:12:20 <Pendragon> Oh shit, it's an eva core.

04:13:34 <Pendragon> That was... interesting.

04:24:02 <Pendragon> how possible

04:25:01 <Pendragon> Moose, you've watched the rebuilds so far, yes?
04:25:12 <thedeadlymoose> Pendragon: Nope. Waiting them to be done.
04:25:25 <thedeadlymoose> Which... won't be til winter next year earliest. :(
04:25:30 <Pendragon> I would watch them. Their take on the Unit 03 fight is fucking wonderful.
04:25:36 <thedeadlymoose> I know a few spoilers, which sound awesome, but yeah.
04:25:39 <Pendragon> Or at least watch the unit 03 fight.

04:30:45 <Bouncl> are we talking
04:30:46 <Bouncl> about
04:30:46 <Pendragon> Definetly.
04:30:46 <Bouncl> eva
04:30:48 <Bouncl> because
04:30:50 <Bouncl> i fucking love eva
04:31:00 <Pendragon> I was just talking about the rebuilds.
04:31:28 <Bouncl> i love the rebuilds 
04:31:31 <Bouncl> watch the rebuilds moose 
04:31:33 <Bouncl> watch them
04:31:50 <Bouncl> dexanote doesn't like them
04:31:51 <Pendragon> I was just talking about how I have the unit 03's fight song stuck in my head.
04:31:53 <Bouncl> that's how you know they're good 
04:32:08 <Pendragon> And am activley listening to it.
04:32:24 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl I absolutely will. I'm saving them
04:32:28 <thedeadlymoose> They sound amazing
04:32:35 <Bouncl> you don't have to wait for the fourth to come out
04:32:38 <Dexanote> thedeadlymoose: the rebuilds are great
04:32:39 <Bouncl> they're all pretty self contained 
04:32:39 <thedeadlymoose> Also, right now, I'm listening to the Ode to Joy EVA cover
04:32:41 <Dexanote> until the third
04:32:48 <Bouncl> shhh dexanote 
04:32:48 <Dexanote> in which case Shinji actually grabs an idiot ball
04:32:52 * Bouncl puts hand on dexanote's mouth
04:32:56 <Bouncl> your opinion is bad
04:32:58 * Dexanote licks his palm
04:32:58 <Bouncl> feel bad about it 
04:33:05 <Dawley> Rebuild is enjoyable
04:33:14 <Dexanote> really though the rebuilds > series for me
04:33:19 <Dexanote> if only for animation quality
04:33:22 <thedeadlymoose> I recall reading the Rebuild 3 summary and feeling it would work better if I watched it once 3 came out
04:33:23 <Dexanote> and
04:33:24 <Dexanote> fuck
04:33:26 <thedeadlymoose> errrr once 4 came out
04:33:27 <Dawley> End of 3.0 makes you wonder what the hell Anno's going to do wit the fourth film.
04:33:46 <thedeadlymoose> I may give in and watch 1 and 2 though
04:33:47 <Dexanote> thedeadlymoose: seriously watch them when you can. they're really really well done.
04:33:50 <rumetzen> maybe i should finish watching nge one day
04:34:01 <Bouncl> 1 and 2 are basically just the eva redone 
04:34:01 <thedeadlymoose> rumetzen: You should. Watching the first part...
04:34:03 <Bouncl> quite good 
04:34:06 <thedeadlymoose> The first part is just okay
04:34:11 <Pendragon> I don't like the MP eva preview for 4.0.
04:34:17 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl, yeah, except taking the ending and upending it completely in the most amazing way
04:34:27 <thedeadlymoose> from what I read, of course XD
04:34:35 <Bouncl> you don't know man 
04:34:37 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, im gonna be honest
04:34:47 <rumetzen> the converation with doct still makes me not want to
04:34:48 <rumetzen> :|
04:34:55 * rumetzen incredibly petty
04:34:56 <thedeadlymoose> what conversation with burns
04:34:56 <Bouncl> watch them
04:34:57 <Dawley> thedeadlymoose: 1.0 is almost a shot-for-shot remake of episodes 1-6, 2.0 is the same for the first half and then it goes completely off the rails
04:34:57 <Bouncl> for me
04:35:02 * thedeadlymoose doesn't remember at all
04:35:10 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, the big argument we got into
04:35:13 <thedeadlymoose> Dawley: Yeah, I heard -- I read summaries -- and it sounds amazing
04:35:27 <Pendragon> God fucking dammit akinator
04:35:32 <Pendragon> I hate you so much
04:35:36 <thedeadlymoose> rume: I... vaguely remember? Still, though, it's up to you. You can watch what you want~
04:35:36 <Dawley> I got into Eva the same week they released 2.0 on DVD. Good times, no waiting
04:35:42 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, Yeah I know
04:35:48 <rumetzen> I'm really just beng stupid and petty
04:35:50 <rumetzen> like always
04:35:51 <rumetzen> :U
04:35:52 <Pendragon> I saw 1.0 in theaters.
04:35:54 <thedeadlymoose> :P
04:35:57 <Pendragon> It was FUCKING awesome.
04:35:59 <thedeadlymoose> Eva has been a pretty huge influence on me writing wise; I saw it in high school
04:36:12 <thedeadlymoose> I still remember almost all of it
04:36:18 <Pendragon> I do too.
04:36:22 <thedeadlymoose> and I've watched much longer series and remember almost nothing XD
04:36:22 <Pendragon> Besides the filler episodes.
04:36:28 <thedeadlymoose> lol, well, yeah
04:36:34 <thedeadlymoose> It's funny how laser-focused it got
04:36:38 <thedeadlymoose> And from the beginning you're just
04:36:39 <thedeadlymoose> not prepared
04:36:41 <thedeadlymoose> hahaha
04:36:57 <Bouncl> "Sit down young child"
04:36:59 <thedeadlymoose> "wait"
04:37:00 <Bouncl> "I have a story for you"
04:37:03 <Bouncl> "the backdrop is giant robots"
04:37:05 <thedeadlymoose> "what happened to the wacky penguin"
04:37:10 <thedeadlymoose> "...there was a wacky penguin"
04:37:13 <thedeadlymoose> "...help me"
04:37:13 <Pendragon> It's like "hey kid where you expecting gundams TOO BAD HERE COME ENGAGING CHARACTERS AAAHAHAHHAHAHA"
04:37:16 <Bouncl> "the story is why everything is fucking awful and you're all alone."
04:37:24 <rumetzen> Hey
04:37:31 <rumetzen> I'll be 19 in 20 minutes
04:37:37 <thedeadlymoose> "also the apocalypse is the worst/weirdest end to loneliness imaginable"
04:37:39 <Silber> steam summer sale has about 12 hours left --what should I grab while th chance is had

04:38:02 <Silber> rumetzen: oh god vou're three vears voungr than me
04:38:09 <Dr_Kens> rumetzen: DANG MAN YOU YOUNG AS FUCK.
04:38:10 <rumetzen> silber i am
04:38:20 <rumetzen> lol everyone is always shocked to hear how young i am
04:38:20 <thedeadlymoose> Silber: Dishonored is also good
04:38:26 <Bouncl> Silber: 
04:38:27 <thedeadlymoose> So is Dragon Age (better than it sounds)
04:38:29 * MisterFlames doesn't mention how much younger rumetzen is.
04:38:35 <thedeadlymoose> as is Fallout New Vegas
04:38:42 <rumetzen> MisterFlames, quiet gramps
04:38:42 <Silber> I have FONV
04:38:46 <Bouncl> Dishonored, Battleblock Theater, Dark Souls, Xcom, Farcry 3, Fallout 
04:38:49 <Dawley> New Vegas surprised me
04:38:50 <MisterFlames> I need to finish DA:O
04:38:51 <Bouncl> all of those are excellent 
04:39:05 <Silber> I havn't bought anvthing this sale because I have a huge backlog and Sophos is awesome
04:39:09 <Pendragon> Is it bad I have over 120 hours logged on skyrim
04:39:23 <Pendragon> I haven't bought anything because my money is going to computer parts.
04:39:28 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl: I almost got FarCry3 but I haven't played any of the other games
04:39:35 <Bouncl> me neither
04:39:35 <Silber> but
04:39:38 <Bouncl> still good 
04:39:43 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl: and also it seems kind of racist :/
04:39:44 <Silber> I am picking up Retrograde
04:39:49 <Dawley> Check out Blood Dragon. It's awesomeness in a 5 gig package
04:39:56 <Silber> so I might as well grab some other stuff while I'm at it
04:39:59 * thedeadlymoose hates to break that bit out, but it's the main reason I haven't bought it
04:40:03 <Pendragon> it's everything DNF should have been,.
04:40:05 <Silber> like, uh
04:40:07 <Bouncl> fair 
04:40:17 <Silber> Super House of Dead Ninjas
04:40:23 <Bouncl> i never finished it because it crashes at a certain point for me
04:40:24 <Silber> that looks worth $1.25
04:40:32 <Bouncl> but i got a fair bit in and ran around the island and stuff 
04:40:40 <Silber> oh dear it's actuallv $1.74
04:40:45 <Pendragon> One game everyone needs to play: Castle Crashers
04:40:47 <thedeadlymoose> I mean, on one hand, I played resident evil 5 literally to the point of getting every unlock and on hardest difficulty
04:40:51 <thedeadlymoose> but
04:40:51 <Silber> that's wav more expensive
04:40:53 <Silber> also
04:41:00 <thedeadlymoose> I also did that because I did it with my partner on split screen coop :P
04:41:06 <Bouncl> vov
04:41:08 <thedeadlymoose> FarCry3 is just, like, a game
04:41:09 <thedeadlymoose> XD
04:41:12 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, far cry 3 is super fun
04:41:15 <Bouncl> if it makes you uncomfortable do not buy it 
04:41:19 * thedeadlymoose for context, re5 is super racist
04:41:19 <rumetzen> with neat characters
04:41:19 <Pendragon> MGR:R is on sale.
04:41:21 <Bouncl> it's not like
04:41:23 <Bouncl> you're doing a bad thing 
04:41:26 <Silber> Pndragon, Bouncl, whvre were vou to convince me whvn Castlv Crashers and Battleblock were 90% off
04:41:36 <GoldenDragon> Pendragon Rules of nature!
04:41:39 <Bouncl> "oh man this game has fucked up subtext you better buy it or you're a bad person" 
04:41:42 <thedeadlymoose> Bouncl: It's partly more that I can't figure out to what extent it will make it unplayable for me from reading previews
04:41:42 <Bouncl> Silber: i was buying it
04:41:45 <Bouncl> where were you 
04:41:45 <thedeadlymoose> hahahahahahahaha
04:42:04 <thedeadlymoose> also, Silber, bioshock infinite, but that's probably obvious
04:42:09 <Pendragon> Found the senior staff boat trip: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/784/892/5f0.gif
04:42:09 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, it was enough for me to "uh wait a minute" so yeah
04:42:16 <rumetzen> you probably wouldn't be a fan
04:42:29 <Silber> being stingv
04:42:35 <Bouncl> plus the main character is just a huge jackass 
04:43:04 <thedeadlymoose> that can be difficult to deal with as well
04:43:10 <thedeadlymoose> maybe I'll buy it when it gets even cheaper
04:43:16 <thedeadlymoose> in like a year or two
04:43:51 <rumetzen> On the bright side, the creators have recognized the problem
04:43:57 <rumetzen> and are trying to fix it with the sequel
04:44:04 <thedeadlymoose> oh, that's cool
04:44:12 <thedeadlymoose> still, the upshot
04:44:15 <thedeadlymoose> dark souls, silber
04:44:23 * thedeadlymoose sidles up to Silber.
04:44:29 * thedeadlymoose whispers in ear.
04:44:34 * thedeadlymoose "Dark Soulsssssssssss."
04:44:59 <Pendragon> Welcome to dark souls
04:45:12 <Pendragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYbOVTQnbAA
04:45:14 <thedeadlymoose> I'm tempted to buy it myself because I don't have it on PC
04:45:18 <thedeadlymoose> But I think I'm being silly
04:45:28 <Pendragon> RIP Flipping Havel
04:45:33 <Bouncl> oh
04:45:39 <rumetzen> The PC version is terrible unless you have a controller
04:45:40 <rumetzen> fyi

04:50:10 * Pendragon is banished to the shadow realm

04:58:49 <Silber> I'm looking at a rviw of Omikron
04:58:52 <Bouncl> i think you are speaking from a pvp perspective 
04:58:55 <Silber> and it has this xplanation
04:58:57 <Bouncl> to which i say this
04:58:59 <Silber> "In fact, you're told, Omikron is a game created by demons in order to capture our souls."
04:59:00 <Bouncl> if you tryhard at pvp
04:59:02 <Bouncl> you are a fucking loser
04:59:10 <Pendragon> You need to git gud.
04:59:24 <Pendragon> You're the one who leveled dex
04:59:28 <Silber> Omikron is the Demon Souls ofthe 90s
04:59:41 <Bouncl> i dunno man
04:59:47 <Bouncl> you seem to care a lot about dex builds
05:00:04 <Pendragon> None are greater than the father of giants.

05:40:05 <Bouncl> rumetzen, you will never not feel like that 
05:40:10 <BlackWing> Shinji needs to get laid
05:40:13 <Bouncl> no
05:40:16 <Bouncl> jesus blackwing
05:40:16 <Kidd> Hmmmm
05:40:16 <BlackWing> Yes
05:40:23 <Bouncl> why
05:40:35 <Bouncl> there's so
05:40:39 <Bouncl> that's
05:40:43 <Bouncl> i'm not having this discussion
05:40:44 <BlackWing> End of Evangelion. Hospital. That is all.
05:40:45 <Pendragon> The rebuild abridged is hilarious.
05:40:53 <Pendragon> BLACKWING STOP
05:40:58 <Pendragon> Stop right fucking there
05:41:02 <Pendragon> We do not talk about that scene
05:41:03 <rumetzen> does rebuild have better animation
05:41:13 <thedeadlymoose> goddammit
05:41:15 <BlackWing> I do believe I said "That is all" as in "Nothing more needs to be said about it."
05:41:15 <thedeadlymoose> lol
05:41:15 <Pendragon> Yes.
05:41:25 <Kidd> Hmmm
05:41:26 <rumetzen> Pemander, is it too...
05:41:28 <rumetzen> fucked up?
05:41:30 <Pendragon> @Rumetzen
05:41:31 <thedeadlymoose> rume: rebuild isn't done, and also I think works better as a sequel
05:41:34 * rumetzen terrible at puns
05:41:36 <BlackWing> Rebuild has *so* much better animation
05:41:38 <thedeadlymoose> I mean...
05:41:42 <rumetzen> thedeadlymoose, hm
05:41:43 <Bouncl> rumetzen by far 
05:41:44 <Pendragon> Rebuild is also pretty different
05:41:50 <rumetzen> I'm gona be honest
05:41:53 <Pendragon> Like a 3rd angel and no DDR angel
05:41:56 <thedeadlymoose> the thing with evangelion + rebuild is that while the second is technically a reboot
05:42:00 <rumetzen> I'm still not 100% what the fuck NGE is about
05:42:00 <rumetzen> like
05:42:03 <rumetzen> there are angels
05:42:04 <rumetzen> and mecha
05:42:06 <thedeadlymoose> it's also implied to be in continuity with the first
05:42:09 <Pemander> I was pinged.
05:42:09 <rumetzen> and one of the mecha is his mom?
05:42:15 <rumetzen> or maybe im misremembering thing
05:42:15 <thedeadlymoose> rume: souls
05:42:16 <Pemander> Why/!
05:42:18 <BlackWing> rumetzen: All the Evas are mothers
05:42:19 <thedeadlymoose> nah, you're right
05:42:29 <rumetzen> and like
05:42:31 <Bouncl> man guys
05:42:31 <Pendragon> Rumetzen: the best way to explain is to just watch it.
05:42:32 <BlackWing> Asuka's mom's soul is in her Eva
05:42:32 <rumetzen> the ending gets weird
05:42:32 <Bouncl> don't spoil it 
05:42:36 <Pendragon> WAIT WHAT
05:42:37 <thedeadlymoose> hahahaha
05:42:39 <rumetzen> and i think there's alternate universes somehow
05:42:42 <Bouncl> you motherfuckers
05:42:43 <rumetzen> that's really all i know
05:42:43 <thedeadlymoose> okay let's probably stop spoiling
05:42:44 <Pendragon> Blackwing I didn't even know that
05:42:46 <Bouncl> ruining the experience 
05:42:49 <thedeadlymoose> rume: not... quite
05:42:52 <BlackWing> Pendragon: You didn't?
05:42:53 <thedeadlymoose> more like
05:42:55 <thedeadlymoose> in sequence
05:42:56 <Pemander> Oh, rumetzen said my name by MISTAKE.
05:43:00 <Pemander> I see how it is.
05:43:06 <thedeadlymoose> XD
05:43:08 <Bouncl> rumetzen doesn't love you like i do Pemander 
05:43:15 <rumetzen> Pemander, oh shit yeah
05:43:19 <rumetzen> i meant to ping pendragon
05:43:21 <rumetzen> :U
05:43:30 <rumetzen> anyone
05:43:34 <Pemander> No one loves me quite like you do, Bouncl.
05:43:40 <Bouncl> <3
05:43:42 <rumetzen> i guess it's time to watch shinji beat the shit out of bird-skullface
05:43:48 <Bouncl> yeah 
05:43:51 <Pendragon> Blackwing I didn't. I know most everything els
05:44:06 <Pendragon> Sachiel is a pretty meh angel.
05:44:11 <Pendragon> Standard fare first angel.
05:44:25 <Pendragon> They REALLY get interesting at the 9th on.
05:45:01 <rumetzen> I think I've watched up to the big diamond one before
05:45:08 <rumetzen> but I'm starting at the beginning this time
05:45:12 <Pendragon> Ramiel is weird.
05:45:16 <Pendragon> One of the strongest.
05:46:27 <Pendragon> I know most of the Angel's names.
05:51:08 <BlackWing> Pendragon: Yea, Asuka's mother is in her Eva. S'why she went cuckoo and hanged a doll believing it was Asuka
05:51:40 <BlackWing> The part of Asuka's mother that loved her daughter
05:51:53 <Pendragon> God the Arael episode was creepy.
05:51:56 <BlackWing> Or some mysticism mumbo-jumbo

06:37:47 <ProcyonLotor> spoiler alert?
06:38:19 <MorgiePie> I think that one was 6 characters in a room?
06:38:25 <MorgiePie> Can't remember the number but w/e
06:38:31 <ProcyonLotor> yeah
06:38:34 <ProcyonLotor> there were like

06:38:39 <ProcyonLotor> in a circular room

06:55:36 <PeppersGhost> Analysis: Nope, sorry. Back to the drawing board. 
06:55:47 <Bunton> Stab the subjects in the head.
06:56:23 <PeppersGhost> MorganPie: The foundation has a surplus of pale, emotionless things that kill for no reason. 
06:56:33 <MorgiePie> Yeah, I know
06:56:38 <Bunton> "Any matter that enters this red colored area will be [DATA EXPUNGED] and become unrecoverable"
06:56:49 <Bunton> What is behind this data expunged?
06:57:14 <PeppersGhost> "Agent ██████ has not been reprimanded for his actions."
06:57:16 <PeppersGhost> No. 
06:57:23 <PeppersGhost> He would certainly be reprimanded for killing a skip.
06:57:28 <Bunton> ^
06:57:31 <Bunton> Also "SCP-XXXX-1 appears to expand in radius approximately ██cm every █ minutes"
06:57:35 <Bunton> Why are these numbers redacted?
06:57:49 <PeppersGhost> These things violate the laws of reality. There's no telling if the universe would remain in one piece if these anomalies are killed.
06:57:50 <MorgiePie> K
06:58:11 <MorgiePie> Well, that was kinda the point I was going for
06:58:14 <PeppersGhost> So would Agent Blackbox be reprimanded for potentially blowing up reality?
06:58:17 <PeppersGhost> Yes, yes he would.
06:58:29 <JConwell> Heh
06:58:40 <MorgiePie> How should he be reprimanded, termination, just don't even bring it up?
06:59:17 <PeppersGhost> I think that's kind of a moot point since this whole thing seems to be built on some very shaky concepts
06:59:36 <PeppersGhost> It's like you have two completely different SCPs in this one article, and unfortunately, neither of them is very original or interesting
06:59:43 <Bunton> I'm going to ask the question I always ask.
06:59:48 <MorgiePie> Go for it
06:59:55 <Bunton> What emotion is this supposed to evoke in me, and how is it supposed to evoke that?
06:59:58 <PeppersGhost> I mean, we have over 2000 of these articles. You're going to have to show us something really, truly original if you want to get our attention.
07:00:45 <Bunton> It doesn't have to be something /huge/.
07:00:49 <Bunton> It just has to be different.
07:01:16 <MorgiePie> Well, I suppose the emotion I would like to evoke in the reader is intrigue. 
07:01:21 <MorgiePie> But I see y'alls point
07:01:25 <Bunton> But all good articles evoke some emotion, and you can always identify how that's evoked.
07:01:27 <Bunton> Why?
07:01:28 <MorgiePie> It ain't too good
07:01:33 <Bunton> Why should I be interested in it?
07:01:39 <MorgiePie> Good question
07:01:50 <Bunton> Not in a critical way, but you should always be asking yourself that.
07:01:51 <Randomini> intrigue is boring.
07:02:07 <Bunton> Intrigue is a general emotion that's not really enough by itself.
07:02:19 <Bunton> What you should be asking is "what about this makes me curious?"
07:02:23 <Bunton> "What do I want to understand?"
07:02:30 <MorgiePie> Yeah
07:02:30 <MorgiePie> Hmm
07:02:40 <MorgiePie> Back to the drawling board with me, then. 
07:02:42 <Bunton> "What in this article am I invested in? Do I care about these people?"
07:02:51 <Bunton> Yeah. Don't be discouraged.
07:02:58 <Bunton> It just takes a bit of practice.
07:03:03 <MorgiePie> Oh I never get too discouraged 
07:03:14 <MorgiePie> Thanks for y'alls help
07:03:14 <Bunton> :)
07:03:27 <MorgiePie> Well, at least this one had something of a story
07:03:34 <MorgiePie> Something my last two can't really say.
07:03:34 <Bunton> No problem. Don't worry about asking for help if you need any.
07:03:47 <Bunton> Try bouncing ideas off of people.
07:03:55 <MorgiePie> Sounds like a good idea
07:04:02 <MorgiePie> I think, if I had a solid idea, a premise
07:04:06 <MorgiePie> I would do a lot better
07:04:09 <Bunton> People sometimes say it's not in the idea, it's in the execution, but that's only really true if you've been writing scips for a while.
07:04:20 <Bunton> Having a good idea makes the execution a fup-ton easier.
07:04:33 <MorgiePie> Woo, 2000 scips 
07:04:45 <MorgiePie> Finding an original idea is gonna be a pisser. 
07:04:46 <Bunton> Also it's a lot easier to just examine the idea rather than having to extrapolate it from the article.
07:04:59 <Bunton> There's always something different. People will have suggestions.
07:05:23 <MorgiePie> Well, thanks for y'alls help 
07:05:34 <MorgiePie> Also, grey skinned humanoids 
07:05:36 <Bunton> Be warned you might have to bounce a good few ideas off before you hit that gem that'll make a brilliant first article.
07:05:51 <MorgiePie> They appear in so many reg creepypastas and such
07:05:57 <MorgiePie> What's with grey skin?
07:06:25 * PeppersGhost shrugs
07:06:44 <PeppersGhost> And yes, you'll definitely have a better time if you for the right concept to come along
07:06:51 <PeppersGhost> * if you wait 
07:06:52 <Bunton> It's just a standard trope. People want to tap into the uncanny valley effect, so they just think "grek skin, sharp teeth... uh..."
07:07:07 <MorgiePie> I should write a creepypasta where the narrator finds a creature with disgusting, pink skinned freak that's overly muscled
07:07:10 <Bunton> "Too many arms, that's a good one."
07:07:12 <PeppersGhost> Humanoids with grey skin and sharp teeth are scary
07:07:17 <PeppersGhost> … the first dozen times or so
07:07:26 <MorgiePie> And the narrator turns out to be a gaunt, grey skinned humanoid
07:07:29 <PeppersGhost> we are a jaded bunch here. 
07:07:32 <Bunton> It's not so much that it actually scares the writer as it is just really easy to think of.
07:07:43 <PeppersGhost> "No, John, you are the grey-skinned humanoid."
07:07:47 <Bunton> It's hard to be scared by your own creation.
07:07:55 <PeppersGhost> And then John was grey-skinned humanoid.
07:08:09 <Bunton> So people sometimes think something that isn't scary to them will still be scary to others.
07:08:16 <Bunton> Genuine scary is hard to write.
07:08:18 <MorgiePie> They're like creepypastas version of the zombie
07:08:22 <PeppersGhost> "I should write a creepypasta where the narrator finds a creature with disgusting, pink skinned freak that's overly muscled"
07:08:26 <PeppersGhost> That actually sounds like a hilarious idea
07:08:32 <Bunton> It helps if you understand what makes proper scary stories scary.
07:08:38 <PeppersGhost> That could even work as an SCP, maybe???
07:08:43 <Bunton> Peppers: mmmmm.
07:08:44 <Soulless> going to be
07:08:45 <Soulless> bed
07:08:49 <Soulless> see you all on the other side
07:08:55 <Bunton> Maybe not for yer first, but it could work.
07:08:56 <Bunton> Maybe.
07:09:01 <PeppersGhost> Standard emaciated grey-skinned monstrosity, but totally sentient and sees normal peeps as boogidy-boos
07:09:05 <PeppersGhost> G'night Soulless!

07:09:31 <Bunton> Try going through creepypasta or scips and finding one that gives you the willies.
07:09:40 <Bunton> And then ask yourself "why does this frighten me?"
07:09:48 <MorgiePie> Imprisoned by a bunch of the freaks who keep other innocent grey skins in a sadistic hell-lab. 
07:09:52 <MorgiePie> Hmm
07:09:56 <Bunton> "Is there a particular phrase or sentence that scared me?"
07:10:03 <MorgiePie> I always really hated (in a good way) "barbie.avi" 
07:10:06 <Bunton> "At what part was I frightened, and why did that part frighten me?"
07:10:15 <Bunton> Try re-reading it and doing some analysis.
07:10:28 <MorgiePie> Because the way the writer describes the interview with the woman, and the sentence 'the plastic tarp was cleaned' 
07:10:28 <Bunton> It'll help, I promise.
07:10:44 <MorgiePie> Well, that sentence was badly parapharsed 
07:10:45 <Bunton> Yeah. Once you've identified that, you can extrapolate it.
07:10:50 <Bunton> And use it elsewhere.
07:10:50 <MorgiePie> But ya get the idea
07:11:14 <Bunton> Which isn't plagiarism, since you're extracting individual elements and techniques rather than big concepts.
07:11:38 <MorgiePie> I remember when I was little fella and first read 'white with red'

07:12:49 <Bunton> Nah, no worries.

07:12:53 <Bunton> You can go to bed if you want.

07:14:21 <MorgiePie> Trying to get a part time job 
07:14:32 <MorgiePie> I've applied to a few places, but you know how it is

07:15:27 <MorgiePie> Just dropped off an app to a pet store
07:15:38 <MorgiePie> Cleaning rabbit shit for minimum wage, yay
07:15:55 <Bunton> I'm trying to apply to pretty much the same job for nothing.
07:15:56 <Bunton> :p
07:16:14 <MorgiePie> Volunteer work?
07:16:22 <Bunton> Yeah.
07:16:37 <Bunton> Need to pad out me CV.
07:16:41 <MorgiePie> Well, at least they don't have dogs or cats

07:28:35 <JConwell> Or at least that is what they want us to believe... >_>
07:28:48 <Korppi> Yikes, that little thing that happened must be part of a larger behind the scenes thing
07:28:53 <Korppi> *shrug*
07:28:58 <Korppi> none of my business

07:31:05 <Korppi> People's answers to this question have been bugging me
07:31:29 <lfairy> both
07:31:35 <lfairy> seriously
07:31:38 <Korppi> :I 
07:31:45 <Randomini> instrument
07:31:48 <lfairy> that person's holding the things out there
07:32:02 <lfairy> can't you just grab 'em?
07:32:13 <Korppi> That's not the point :I
07:32:41 <Korppi> I've seen a majority go for the blue
07:32:46 <Korppi> Which honestly surprised me
07:32:54 <lfairy> well, I'm in creative mode right now, not following-rules mode :V
07:33:06 <Korppi> I feel like speaking /every/ language is a bit more useful
07:33:18 <Korppi> Especially since it doesn't say "Earth" languages
07:33:32 <lfairy> I probably should switch back before coding again
07:33:47 <Randomini> it also doesn't specify "instrument"
07:33:53 <Randomini> guns are instruments of warfare
07:33:57 <Korppi> I..
07:34:01 <Korppi> I didn't think of that
07:34:01 <Randomini> swords, too
07:34:13 <Randomini> pretty much everything is an instrument
07:34:20 <Randomini> scissors are instruments for cutting
07:34:23 <lfairy> brains are instruments... of thought?
07:34:29 <Randomini> congratulations, you are a master hairdresser
07:34:49 <Korppi> However, the majority of people who answered blue were talking about music. So I'm still surprised
07:35:55 <Randomini> music is a more marketable skill
07:36:29 <Randomini> also, fluency isn't the same as genuine comprehension
07:36:39 <Randomini> I know a lot of people who are nominally fluent in english
07:36:49 <Randomini> but don't understand proper sentence structure
07:36:50 <lfairy> I guess Randomini has a point. One billion people speak Chinese
07:37:00 <Randomini> also, you can't write in those languages, just speak
07:37:07 <Randomini> so you can't even read imported books
07:37:12 <Korppi> Well now you're just totally picking apart the post. This isn't worded great
07:37:17 <Korppi> I suppose.
07:37:25 <Cain> Aren't languages instruments of communication?
07:37:34 <Cain> Take the blue pill.
07:37:38 <Korppi> I guess the Sci-Fi fan part of me took over
07:37:39 <Cain> You get to be God.
07:38:11 <Korppi> I'm acting like aliens will definetly show up in my lifetime XD
07:38:51 <Randomini> Korppi, the big assumption you're making
07:38:58 <Randomini> is that the aliens will have spoken languages.
07:39:06 <Korppi> Touche 
07:39:25 <Randomini> it's quite possible they communicate via bioluminescence or something
07:39:30 <Cain> Oh, yeah, it does stipulate Spoken.
07:39:38 <Korppi> "a thing used in pursuing an aim or policy; a means."
07:39:43 <Korppi> Oh my god
07:39:53 <Korppi> the blue pill really would make you god
07:39:58 <Randomini> instruments are /literally every thing/
07:40:05 <Randomini> anything you can use
07:40:08 <Randomini> you are a master at
07:40:31 <Cain> As long as you can define your purpose.
07:41:03 <Cain> If you're just masturbating in public for the hell of it you're not going anywhere different.
07:41:19 <Randomini> my hand is an instrument baby
07:41:23 <lfairy> You don't get the disadvantages of being a god either
07:41:28 <Cain> But if you're using masturbating in public as an instrument to creep people out, you're gonna get shit done.
07:41:33 <lfairy> since mastering your own mind gives you self-control and motivation
07:41:59 <Piefish> Woah woah woah
07:42:02 <Korppi> So by the broad definition of "instrument".... you could learn any language you need to if it's a means to an end
07:42:07 <Piefish> Let's stop the masturbating in public topic pls?
07:42:24 <Randomini> sorry, couldn't hear you piefish

07:46:06 <Piefish> And tbh it's not that much BS, I could actually use a lot of the people skills I have :P
07:46:34 <Bunton> You have to get management experience from somewhere, so deputy manager seems a good place for people to start.
07:46:46 <Bunton> You can't really do management volunteer work, after all.

07:59:04 <Piefish> Let's have the player go through the same room 10000 times cause level design is boring
07:59:12 <Korppi> I mean like, videos where people took bits of video and put them to a song
07:59:14 <Piefish> OST and reach were the only ones I liked
07:59:20 <Piefish> ODST*
07:59:40 <Korppi> And I disagree on the gameplay front, but I'm to sleepy to debate
08:00:00 <Piefish> Ehhh, I think it's pretty samey but meh :P
08:00:09 <Korppi> Opinions
08:00:12 <Korppi> Yaay
08:00:20 <Piefish> I keep playing Wolfenstein: The New order lately
08:00:21 <Dexanote> Cain: omg
08:00:23 <Piefish> is such a good game
08:00:24 <Dexanote> Obsolote Man
08:00:31 <Dexanote> Great episode
08:00:36 <Piefish> Apart from one flaw which I ended up writing a tumblr post aboot
08:00:38 <Korppi> You want to know what makes me sound like a console pleb
08:00:49 <Korppi> Halo is literally my favorite FPS franchise
08:00:56 <Korppi> But I'm primarily a PC gamer
08:01:02 <Cain> Dexanote: Right?
08:01:06 <Piefish> ./kick Korppi Dirty console peasant
08:01:10 <Piefish> :P
08:01:24 <Dexanote> its so good
08:01:43 <Dexanote> i have the whole series on my hd
08:02:33 <Korppi> I'm also super hyped for Destiny. 
08:02:45 <Piefish> Ehhh 
08:02:47 <Korppi> Bungie back at Sci-Fi worldbuilding
08:02:48 <Piefish> I wish it was on PC
08:02:51 <Korppi> hnnnng
08:03:00 <Piefish> And tbh I'm not overly keen on it
08:03:05 <Korppi> I do to. But I can live *shrug*
08:03:09 <Korppi> I /loved/ the Alpha
08:03:10 <Piefish> I can't :(
08:03:25 <Piefish> I only has PC now (well I have a 360 but I cba to connect it up
08:03:32 <Korppi> Well it's over so obviously :P
08:03:49 <Korppi> I have a PS4 and PS3
08:03:55 <Crayne> Piefish, ever played Frozen Synapse?
08:03:58 <Korppi> the 360 is packed in a box
08:04:00 <Piefish> nup
08:04:04 <Korppi> Wanting to be sold
08:04:10 <Crayne> sCool. Just so you know. :P
08:04:13 <Crayne> .y frozen synapse
08:04:19 <Korppi> That's my internal struggle.

08:06:01 <Korppi> Oh man that old opening
08:06:48 <Korppi> It's older than the old opening I usually think of 
08:07:42 <PeppersGhost> Does anyone happen to have that one fuel image of the guy surrounded by floating mail?
08:07:51 <Korppi> Man, I just hope Frederic shows up in Halo 5
08:08:10 <Randomini> so I just solved a narrative problem
08:08:19 <Randomini> simply by writing the following sentence
08:08:21 <Randomini> "Turn on, tune in, drop out, toke up, jack off, you know?"
08:08:40 <Piefish> What
08:08:54 <Randomini> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on,_tune_in,_drop_out
08:09:21 <Piefish> Again what
08:09:23 <Randomini> basically, I'm crossing the GOIs a lot earlier than I was expecting
08:09:27 <Randomini> it also makes the narrative flow a lot smoother, too
08:09:29 <Korppi> I should also probably go and watch all the Spartan Ops cutscenes. Since  I sold all my 360 games before it finished.
08:10:04 <Piefish> Omg
08:10:11 <Piefish> I watched the transformers animated film
08:10:14 <Piefish> this weekend
08:10:24 <Piefish> It was so bizarre
08:10:41 <Piefish> And was way better than anything michael bay could do
08:10:50 <Korppi> I almost said "which one" but then I realized it was obviously /the/ Transformer movie 
08:10:56 <Piefish> Yup
08:11:00 <PeppersGhost> Found it
08:11:01 <PeppersGhost> https://38.media.tumblr.com/8f9d0925986a68b16547256520a5c0df/tumblr_mxbjgpZRO41save0go3_1280.jpg
08:11:02 <Piefish> Dem retro sci fi sounds
08:11:06 <Korppi> You've got the touch! 
08:11:19 <Piefish> Oh yes
08:11:28 <Piefish> There was one thing though
08:11:42 <Piefish> Spike at one point goes "Oh shit! What are we gonna do now?"
08:11:56 <Piefish> I had to listen to that part again to confirm he says "oh shit"
08:12:13 <Piefish> Apparently the 80's was a time when saying "Oh shit!" in a kids film was acceptable
08:12:35 <Korppi> Baha
08:13:37 <Piefish> There was also this bit with these transformers that weren't transformers cause they could only turn into bikes and spoke in a weird Australian accent and the transformers and the aussies became friends and started dancing in a circle
08:13:48 <Piefish> At that point I think the writers just got a bit high
08:14:38 <Piefish> If Michael Bay had basically just remade the old transformers cartoons, following the same plot, the transformers films would be way better
08:15:07 <Piefish> I'm still super pissed that the new film just kinda glosses over the unicron plot
08:15:58 <Piefish> Actually it doesn't even gloss over it, it fucks it in the ass and doesn't have the courtesy to give it a reach around (full metal jacket sort of quote)
08:17:26 <Korppi> Have you watched Transformers Prime?
08:18:03 <Korppi> It's 2 seasons and a movie. I've only watched the first season, but I liked it
08:18:52 <Piefish> nuup

08:25:10 * Piefish does not remember this
08:25:29 <Korppi> It's in Spartan Ops in Halo 4. 
08:25:56 <Korppi> The cutscene for Episode 1 
08:27:11 <Piefish> Does spartan ops give some clue as to what the fuck was going on in halo 4?
08:27:59 <Korppi> Err
08:28:01 <Korppi> I mean
08:28:34 <Randomini> so I just wrote the worst joke
08:28:39 <Korppi> It's more expanded stuff 6 months later. I haven't seen all of it, which is why I'm watching it now
08:28:41 <Randomini> is anyone from the Broken God team on right now?
08:29:01 <Randomini> I made a terrible, terrible joke and I want to run it past them for narrative consistency
08:29:07 <Korppi> I already understood Halo 4, but it kind of fucks over people who don't know all the expanded lore of Halo
08:30:32 <Korppi> But I'm also the guy who has an $85 Halo 4 action figure :I 
08:31:31 <Piefish> Eh i've spent £500+ on TF2 hats
08:31:46 <Piefish> Also I has valve action figures and a portal gun
08:31:50 <Piefish> as well as other stuff
08:34:22 <Korppi> I love how much everyone hates Doctor Hallsy in this

09:06:52 <Korppi> I've got about 10 minutes left on this, but then I will
09:07:01 <Kidd> Why are the brackets needed?
09:07:18 <Piefish> Cause that's for the make/model
09:07:24 <Kidd> Ah
09:07:31 <Piefish> Anything in square brackets is something that will be changed
09:07:37 <Piefish> I just haven't figured out what to yet

09:10:33 <Piefish> lemme add that in
09:10:46 <Kidd> Ok
09:13:13 <Kidd> Piefish: you have a bunch of missing commas in the interviews
09:13:52 <Piefish> Where?
09:15:04 <Kidd> Well I wouldn't say I know them well but they always say hello to me and wave to me and such.
09:15:29 <Kidd> Comma before but and before and
09:16:06 <Korppi> That was an hour of awesome
09:16:16 <Korppi> Okay more like 50 minutes but still
09:16:17 <Kidd>  Sorry did you say they wave at you?
09:16:28 <Kidd> Need a comma before did
09:16:39 <Kidd> Korppi what did you do?
09:16:41 <lfairy> What happened Korppi?
09:17:17 <Korppi> Oh, I was watching a video that put all the Spartan Ops cutscenes from Halo 4 into one video
09:17:32 <Korppi> Because I got rid of my Xbox before all the episodes were out
09:17:35 <Kidd> Piefish: They aren't in trouble are they?
09:17:42 <Kidd> Comma before are
09:17:53 <Kidd> And everything I said above 
09:17:59 <Piefish> Kidd: both "but" and "and" are connectives, why o they need commas before them?
09:18:14 <Piefish> other two things changing
09:18:41 <chubert> hey, korppi
09:18:48 <chubert> can you check out a contest tale draft at the moment?
09:19:01 <Korppi> okay, I guess
09:19:09 <chubert> http://sandbox.scp-wiki.net/chubert
09:19:12 <chubert> second-to-last tab
09:19:47 <Kidd> Piefish: ok, no comma on and
09:20:03 <Kidd> But the sentence with but is a compound sentence 
09:20:26 <Kidd> So you need a comma for the conjunction

09:21:53 <chubert> just using the terminology from the wanderery's library :p

09:23:03 <Kidd> Piefish: Well of course if they were actually bulldozers I'd be surprised but they're not actually bulldozers.
09:23:12 <Kidd> Comma before but

09:28:02 <Kidd> Piefish: the second interview seems unnecessary 
09:28:35 <Korppi> I do find it funny that you and TG have fumbling agents/soldiers of the CI. Yet I for some reason thought they would be more professional. 
09:28:51 <chubert> TG has that?
09:29:12 <chubert> well, either way
09:29:26 <chubert> i would figure that the CI is capable of fielding soldiers of equal quality to the foundation

09:29:36 <chubert> they just have a ton of conscripted, untrained alpas to use as cannon fodder :p
09:29:44 <Korppi> Well not fumbling, just unproffesional. But to be fair she herself was anomalous and the whole story takes place after the assignment

10:21:26 <Athena_Grey>  /every/ item we have is explicitly anomalous in some way
10:22:22 <Athena_Grey> isn't that supposed to at least ping people's Suspension of Disbelief alarm?
10:22:52 <GoldenDragon> I ask because was thinking of having my SCP's containment cell built with a thin layer of telekill alloy sandwiched between the standard material
10:23:08 <Athena_Grey> ooh Telekill
10:23:21 <Athena_Grey> that's one of my fave element of Classic SCP, actually XD
10:23:37 <GoldenDragon> though now that I think about it that seems a little overboard for an SCP that can invade someone's memories
10:23:43 <FlameShirt> why do people believe that a story featuring torture-deaths of thieves and minor rabble-rousers are stories of moral paragoninity? 
10:23:54 <FlameShirt> because people are silly billies
10:25:05 <FlameShirt> also, paragoninity is totally a real word i didn't make up
10:25:39 <Athena_Grey> paragoninity 
10:25:52 <Athena_Grey> FlameShirt my autocorrect disagrees :P
10:26:08 <FlameShirt> autocorrect can do one

10:36:58 <EdAWACS> how is everyone doing today?
10:37:06 <Gujzo> Just woke up
10:37:11 <Gujzo> Extremely tired

10:37:37 <EdAWACS> oh hello gujzo are you new?
10:37:55 <EdAWACS> that looks lovely thegreekowl did you draw that?
10:38:06 <Gujzo> TheGreekOwl: verily
10:38:33 <Gujzo> I joined the Foundation couple of days ago but made my impression in the chat
10:38:56 <EdAWACS> I see gujzo
10:38:58 <EdAWACS> that
10:39:03 <EdAWACS> 's nice
10:39:24 <TheGreekOwl> EdAWACS: No, I paint better then that
10:39:51 <EdAWACS> I see thegreekowl that's nice
10:40:06 <Athena_Grey> is everyone also working on their Contest entry?
10:40:27 * EdAWACS raises his hand
10:40:36 <EdAWACS> I'm doing scp-1853
10:41:04 <Athena_Grey> I think I may do a write-up on SCP-961
10:41:20 <EdAWACS> scp-961
10:41:44 <Athena_Grey> if only because that damn sundial kinda ruined our vision on what Alexylva is like, and we'd better find some Clever Retcon somehow
10:41:52 <Athena_Grey> also
10:41:57 <EdAWACS> ?
10:42:01 <Athena_Grey> .y hunger games catching fire trailer
10:42:15 <Gujzo> I dont like the movies
10:42:15 <Athena_Grey> wait no wrong one
10:42:27 <EdAWACS> wait look at this one 
10:42:29 <EdAWACS> http://9gag.com/gag/aWZrOo4?ref=fbp

10:43:21 <Athena_Grey> .y the hunger games mockingjay teaser
10:43:23 <Athena_Grey> ^^ that
10:43:25 <Gujzo> Whats funny is is that there is no garuntee the star will go supernova :3
10:43:32 <EdAWACS> yeah
10:43:36 <EdAWACS> I know right?
10:43:58 <EdAWACS> welp going to play me some notd 
10:44:11 <Gujzo> Also, the only reason the movie should be split into two parts is if they include EVERY single word straight to the script
10:44:49 <Gujzo> Im pretty critical about book-to-movie deals
10:45:01 <PeppersGhost> Given how weak the third book was, I'm hoping that they'll use the extra time to fix the pacing issues
10:45:42 <Gujzo> PeppersGhost let's just hope they get freaking District 13 right
10:45:52 <EdAWACS> hello peppersghost!
10:45:55 <Athena_Grey> I have not read the second or third book
10:46:02 <PeppersGhost> They've been pretty good about getting all the important stuff right in the first two movies
10:46:03 <Athena_Grey> or since any movie beyond the first
10:46:07 <PeppersGhost> Heya Ed
10:46:13 <Athena_Grey> I just linked it because it looks like a good teaser
10:46:14 <Gujzo> Don't worry Athena I won't spoil ot for you

11:05:12 <EdAWACS> I personally liked the game
11:05:13 <Gujzo> Its pretty much gta with hacking
11:05:25 <EdAWACS> the reason I'm hooked was this page
11:05:28 <EdAWACS> .g ctos
11:05:45 <EdAWACS> I liked the story
11:05:53 <Piefish> I didn't
11:06:00 <EdAWACS> that's okay...
11:06:09 <Piefish> The protagonist is a vigilante that is also a criminal
11:06:19 <Piefish> So he goes after people doing pretty much the same things he's doing
11:06:23 * EdAWACS shrugs
11:06:29 <Piefish> makes it kinda hard to like a guy that is a criminal himself
11:06:42 <Piefish> Like he's super hypocritical

11:29:30 <Gujzo> Reach cant get into them
11:29:43 <Reach> Alexandra, u r disappoint

11:30:47 <Eskobear> i could never understand why someone needed a chatbot
11:30:49 <Reach> .mtg silver myr
11:30:53 <Eskobear> for a chatroom that isn't MTG related at all
11:30:58 <Eskobear> for MTG search
11:31:01 <Reach> Eskobear: Right, but it is fun!
11:31:11 <Reach> And slow, since there are a bunch of cards.
11:31:31 <Reach> Ah, Eskobear, in your opinion, what is better? Three short tales or one long tale?
11:31:48 <Eskobear> I dunno, some of the grapebots have MTG search, but this is a skybot.
11:31:58 <Eskobear> uh, depends on the actual content of each 
11:32:11 <Sophos> Eskobear: They have .mtg because the official repo comes with it
11:32:19 <Eskobear> if you only have one tale's worth of material, splitting it into three tales is gonna seem like page spammy
11:32:30 <Sophos> You're not George Lucas
11:32:36 <Sophos> There's no reason for you split your thing into three
11:33:39 <Reach> Eskobear, Sophos: It has three scenes happening the same environment, and I've been told it is unwieldy for site standards. I don't even know how long is "long" for a typical SCP tale.
11:33:59 <Eskobear> that being said, if you actually have three tales worth of material, combining it into one can get unwieldy 
11:34:05 <Eskobear> can you just, like, link them?
11:34:17 <Reach> What, link you the draft?
11:34:21 <Eskobear> yeah
11:34:23 <Eskobear> i can glance at it
11:34:42 <Reach> Well, okay. It's a GoI contest entry, though.

11:35:06 <Len> Hello, Reach.
11:35:11 <Len> Why are you in trouble?
11:35:13 <Gujzo> Also I want another opinion on my scp draft. I'll wait until your tale is evaliated though
11:35:16 <Reach> http://borradores-scp-es.wikidot.com/experimental-2-no-tocar-> tab Tale 2. 
11:35:17 <Eskobear> Yeah, no, you're good.
11:35:23 <Deimos> Sup Len
11:35:27 <GoldenDragon> Kay added a short start to my pages description
11:35:34 <Reach> Len: Not in trouble really really. Gujzo: sorryyyy :(
11:35:44 <Gujzo> Its fone
11:35:47 <Gujzo> Fine*
11:36:05 <Eskobear> okay
11:36:18 <Len> Greetings, Deimos.

11:36:27 <Eskobear> i can say that, /without having read it/, the sheer length of the document looks like at least two tales worth
11:36:47 <Deimos> He sent me a postcard from Universe-G214-something or other can't remember.
11:36:53 <Len> :3
11:36:56 * PeppersGhost takes a deep breath
11:37:03 <PeppersGhost> Ooookay. Almost done with this skip.
11:37:04 <Reach> Eskobear: Been told that. Cutting it in two will leave one much longer than the other, though.
11:37:05 <Eskobear> now, I can't say if the suggestion instead should be that you should just, y'know, shorten it
11:37:06 <PeppersGhost> You can do this, Pepper
11:37:16 <Reach> Eskobear: Tried. Failed.

11:39:09 <Len> I am starting to think that a skip I'm working on is too long
11:39:25 <Len> I might create the interview log as a separate page, but I don't really want to.
11:39:40 <Silber> >open a chest
11:39:54 <Gujzo> Let me double check to see my SCP title isnt taken
11:39:56 <Reach> Eskobear: Thanks for your insight. I'll try to shorten it/them tale/s) further.

11:41:26 <Piefish> Second
11:41:27 <Piefish> secure locker only accessible by a keypad lock. Any form of ink is to be kept away from SCP-XXXX-1 to prevent its effects. The code to this keypad is known by senior researchers on-site and shold only be changed every two weeks should only be known by the on-site director and be changed every two months.
11:41:38 <Piefish> The sentence in the middle is unrelated to the sentences around it

11:41:49 <Piefish> keeping the ink away should be after the sentences about the keypad
11:42:03 <PeppersGhost> ?
11:42:07 <Len> Just wondering, why did you use SCP-RRRR in your draft? XD
11:42:08 <Gujzo> Alright
11:42:13 <Len> Most people use "XXXX"
11:42:23 <Len> Or sometimes "####"
11:42:27 <PeppersGhost> Because I don't play by the ruuuules

11:43:44 <outofReach> :3
11:43:46 <Crayne> GoldenDragon: there's nothing much to critique. I will say that your containment procedures aren't /special/ containment procedures.
11:43:57 <Piefish> the font written by SCP-XXXX-1 is Times New Roman
11:44:01 <Piefish> ehhhhhh
11:44:10 <Piefish> Why is it writing in MS Office fonts?
11:44:18 <Crayne> Also, please don't randomly blurt repeated nonsense like 'boooop'. If you want to tell us something, by all means do so.
11:44:26 <Gujzo> Well the pen has the ability to accuratly depict typing fonts
11:44:27 <Crayne> Hey Reach.
11:44:30 <Gujzo> I should put that in
11:44:51 <Piefish> Ok that seems kinda random
11:45:06 <Gujzo> Well its supposed to be an innaccuracy
11:45:16 <Gujzo> Since Indias main government font is Manga
11:45:20 <Gujzo> Magal*

11:49:28 <GoldenDragon> c:
11:49:35 <Sophos> [Insert #NIGHTOFTHEFREEIPAD joke here]
11:49:36 <Gujzo> Ill edit mine to
11:49:43 <GoldenDragon> hope it's more super special now
11:50:08 <Piefish> Gujzo: a pen writing in a computer font just seems a bit strange to me and not the good strange, it just seems kinda random
11:50:40 <Gujzo> Piefish well it adds to the anomolous properties
11:50:52 <Gujzo> Hand writing a decleration of war isnt very beleivable
11:51:31 <Piefish> Neither is a pen that writes by itself
11:51:36 <HERIC> well atleast it is a relatively common font. it could be the typeface used by Hagelin C-36
11:51:50 <Piefish> I just feel it would add some mystery to it as if it's an entity writing it
11:51:56 <HERIC> an ancient fully mechanical crypto device from sweden
11:52:41 <Piefish> Anyway the idea itself is ok but I doubt I'd upvote it, there's not enough there
11:53:13 <Gujzo> Well i had to retype it and edit it multiple times so a lot is left out
11:53:19 <Gujzo> Also
11:53:37 <Gujzo> Is it alright to say that the writer has the ability to write in these fonts
11:53:56 <Gujzo> Although there is no understanding of how it is able to accuratly write these
11:54:02 <Piefish> Well it's your scip
11:54:06 <Piefish> You can say what you want
11:54:22 <Piefish> but my suspension od disbelief stops at the fact someone can write in perfect times new roman
11:54:50 <Gujzo> I'll try and change the font type to something more resembling hand writing
11:55:03 <Gujzo> NOT COMIC SANS though
11:55:06 <Gujzo> Im not an idiot
11:55:14 <Piefish> comic sans
11:55:16 <Piefish> COMIC SANS
11:55:21 <Piefish> MUCH COMIC SANS
11:55:24 <Piefish> MANY HANDWRITING
11:55:26 <Gujzo> NUH
11:55:33 <outofReach> Let me stop you right there. 
11:55:34 <Piefish> SUCH AUTHENTICITY 
11:55:40 <Piefish> SO WOW
11:55:53 <outofReach> Comic Sans is not that horribly. This meme has gone for so long it's getting annoying. Too. 
11:55:58 <outofReach> horrible*
11:56:32 <outofReach> Comic Sans is not good, but it's not "I'm not an idiot because I've discarded Comic Sans."
11:56:57 * outofReach goes back into lurking.
11:56:58 <Piefish> such discussion
11:57:01 <Piefish> many comic sans
11:57:11 <Piefish> where outofReach go?
11:57:16 <Piefish> will come back?
11:58:11 <Gujzo> So i found a hand writing font in ms word

14:05:41 <Smapti> Silber, according to what I've read, Peter Criss had previously been in a band called "Lips" and Gene came up with the idea of calling them Kiss as an extension thereof.
14:05:44 <Athena_Grey> and does that mean in an alternate universe, there's a band called "Cuddle"?
14:06:16 <Smapti> The original Ace Frehley and Peter Criss aren't in the band anymore. But the guys who play them now were still extremely awesome.
14:07:49 <Smapti> They started their show by having a giant curtain with the band logo being lifted over the stage while "Won't Get Fooled Again" by the Who played on the PA.

14:23:11 <Eskobear> i mean
14:23:14 <Eskobear> i can have freedom of religion
14:23:15 <tahunu> Smapti: I don't see how this can go wrong at /all/!
14:23:27 <Mrtdark1> Smapti, where did "Separation of Church and State" go

14:24:03 <tahunu>  /businessist/
14:24:10 <tahunu> :U
14:24:40 <Smapti> Hmm. It's a narrow decision.
14:25:05 <Smapti> Corporations only have freedom of religion //if// the corporation is closely owned by a small group of people with a shared faith.
14:25:16 <Eskobear> what
14:25:19 <Eskobear> that's
14:25:23 <Mrtdark1> Which makes sense
14:25:34 <Eskobear> "closely owned" "small group" "shared faith"
14:25:38 <Eskobear> i'm gonna need some definitions now
14:25:47 <DreadLindwyrm> However, surely they're bound by the same law as any "natural" person that they're not allowed to act on that faith if it would be otherwise illegal to do so.
14:25:50 <Eskobear> because that's like just building a loophole factory
14:26:03 <Mrtdark1> Eskobear I think he means like a family corporation or something
14:26:17 <Smapti> The plaintiffs in the suit are a family-owned corporation.

14:36:49 <Insidious_Lars> eyyyyyy
14:36:53 <Insidious_Lars> hows it doin
14:36:56 <Smapti> ...Huh. Some very disturbing information has come to light about an author whose books I was required to read in high school.
14:37:07 <Deimos> Yeah, I probably have some sort of mental instability...
14:38:27 <tahunu> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spIrcYWuM94
14:38:57 <Pendragon> I'm listening to Japanese Cory in the House opening. It's beautiful.
14:39:42 <Insidious_Lars> Smapti, ?
14:40:30 <Smapti> I refer to Marrion Zimmer Bradley. Apparently, her daughter claims that Bradley sexually abused her from the age of 3.
14:40:45 <Eskobear> wait, she was married to the pedophile, right?
14:40:55 <Smapti> Yes.
14:40:59 <Eskobear> like, the overt, NAMBLA-supportive-essay writing one?
14:41:05 <Eskobear> name is escaping me at present
14:41:07 <Smapti> Yeah.
14:41:25 <Gujzo> weird
14:41:30 <Gujzo> wierd*
14:41:31 <Eskobear> but reading essays about how the sci-fi community dealt with him pretty much overtly fucking kids is disturbing to say the least
14:41:32 <Gujzo> whatever
14:41:59 <Eskobear> the sci-fi community was like "well, we write books about aliens that aren't real, and this dude fucks kids, so who should judge who, really"
14:42:25 <Smapti> Her husband, who died in prison for child rape, wrote a full-length book about how it's OK for men to have sex with boys beause ancient Greece.
14:42:40 <Insidious_Lars> Pah.
14:42:47 <Athena_Grey> I need a time machine
14:42:49 <Smapti> He also wrote the definitive encyclopedia on 19th century US coinage which stands to this day.
14:42:50 <Insidious_Lars> Just because it was okay before doesn't mean its okay now.
14:43:21 <Insidious_Lars> Heh.
14:43:29 <DreadLindwyrm> Well, it is a different cultural norm.  They'd have been horrified by the way that we treat our gay populations.
14:43:32 <Smapti> The stuff about her daughter is new, though.
14:43:41 <DreadLindwyrm> And probably our racism,
14:43:55 <djkaktus> .au Gattsune
14:43:57 <Athena_Grey> so that I could try to get him to live without modern... anything. Because anceint Greece
14:44:10 <Smapti> DreadLindwyrm, we actually believe that Macedons and Thracians are **people**. The Greeks would be horrified.
14:44:10 <Smapti> :D
14:44:30 <Eskobear> the Greeks would be horrified that we referred to all of them with one noun
14:44:38 <djkaktus> Geh. Figures.
14:44:52 <DreadLindwyrm> Wouldn't the modern Greeks still be horrified we think Macedonians are people?  :p

14:46:03 <Len> I was wondering who Lumberjack was.
14:46:07 <Insidious_Lars> Its Macedonians.
14:46:16 <Smapti> Yeah. Nala had to be unplugged piece by piece while singing "A Bicycle Built For Two".
14:46:20 <Len> I know, just my little joke, Lars. ;)

14:46:40 <tahunu> Len: A logging bot.
14:46:44 <Insidious_Lars> Who's Lumberjack
14:46:44 <Len> Greetings, Esko.
14:46:50 <Len> I see. Thank you, Tahunu.
14:46:54 <Eskobear> lumberjack is a bot that just sits in here and logs what is said
14:46:57 <Eskobear> and in other rooms
14:46:59 <tahunu> It's funny cause its name is a /pun/
14:47:03 <Smapti> Lumberjack is good at **logging**.
14:47:05 <Insidious_Lars> nice
14:47:15 <Deimos> .ch get skarlet, don't get skarlet
14:47:21 <Eskobear> so if ops or others need to consult past events in chat and nobody had logs, we can just consult the logs
14:47:22 <Insidious_Lars> so does it go to a database?
14:47:23 <Deimos> U sure alexandra?
14:47:25 <Eskobear> that lumberjack logged
14:47:26 <Insidious_Lars> that I can check all the time?
14:47:29 <Eskobear> because lumberjack logs
14:47:30 <Smapti> HE CUTS DOWN TREES, HE EATS HIS LUNCH, HE GOES TO THE LAVATORY
14:47:32 <tahunu> .ch xcom, endless legend, ftl, none
14:47:39 <Smapti> ON WEDNESDAYS HE GOES SHOPPING AND HAS BUTTERED SCONES FOR TEA
14:47:47 <Insidious_Lars> He's a lumberjack and he's okay.
14:47:51 <Eskobear> and bluesoul's love of puns is too strong for all of us
14:47:55 <Insidious_Lars> He logs all night and sleeps all day.
14:48:05 <tahunu> I DON'T TRUST YOUR JUDGEMENT, ALEXANDRA

14:48:32 <Eskobear> also
14:48:35 <tahugamin> Insidious_Lars: Cause laziness
14:48:38 <Eskobear> you guys know that you can just PM the bot
14:48:43 <Eskobear> to avoid fucking with it in chat
14:48:56 <Eskobear> where all of us can see and question your poor judgment
14:49:06 <Smapti> .ch Nala was a fool, Nala was the disease and I am the cure, Nala can't love you like I can

14:50:09 <Tuomey> I realise this may take some effort
14:50:09 <Eskobear> as in, you can not keep spamming up chat with bot calls

16:08:46 <Darktooth> Question. Since I can't seem to find anything else on K-Class scenarios, I was wondering if CK-Class just meant Reconfiguration in general.
16:09:26 <Pendragon> I believe we have a thread providing a *rough* outline of K-Class scenarios.
16:09:34 <lurkd> We do.
16:09:39 <Annalea> Not quite.
16:09:43 <lurkd> Standby I have the link somewhere.
16:09:46 <Annalea> It's a thread containing a list of usages.
16:09:49 <Pendragon> http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/k-class-scenarios
16:09:50 <Darktooth> Was it by Fishmonger?
16:09:53 <Annalea> It is not a canonical list, rough or otherwise.
16:09:54 <Annalea> And no
16:10:03 <Annalea> All content ever contributed by Fishmonger was expunged from the site.
16:10:05 <Pendragon> It's not official but it's a good reference

16:16:11 <tahugamin> Well, fix it then.
16:16:17 <Pendragon> RAAAN IT'S GOJIRAAAA
16:16:17 * tahugamin gives Kens|Labwork some duct tape
16:16:32 <Kens|Labwork> Scientists have published a paper that describes all the chemical-free things in  he world.
16:16:34 <Kens|Labwork> http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/files/2014/06/nchem_-Chemical-Free.pdf
16:16:42 <Gujzo> ooh fascinatin
16:16:52 <Kens|Labwork> For those who don't know, Nature is one of the top names in science.
16:17:03 <tahugamin> HAH
16:17:21 <Pendragon> Here's a picture. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-39UsjavX53I/UIVxVRqvedI/AAAAAAAAJWU/zArDGvxWGtc/s640/Lost+in+the+Mist+(1).jpg
16:17:21 <Gujzo> really
16:17:27 <tahugamin> Kens|Labwork: Niiiiiiiiice xD
16:17:28 <Darktooth> Alright. Since I consider myself a massive idiot, would "Total enslavement of non-human life be considered a K-class event? I can't seem to be smart enough to figure out my own skip. 
16:17:34 <Gujzo> Pendragon NOPE
16:17:39 <Pendragon> Yes.
16:17:44 <Annalea> No.
16:17:53 <Annalea> That's an SK-class Dominance Shift
16:17:54 <Pendragon> Indeed.
16:18:03 * Kens|Labwork waves at Annalea
16:18:11 * Kens|Labwork sends her tea and crumpets.
16:18:14 <Pendragon> Oh, I was responding to Gujzo, not to Darktooth.
16:18:20 * Len waves aggressively at Kens.
16:18:20 <Annalea> SK describes a situation in which humanity is no longer the dominant species of the planet.
16:18:26 * Kens|Labwork waves at Len
16:18:29 <Excraylibur> FUCK
16:18:31 * Len blushes
16:18:33 <Excraylibur> Nigeria goals
16:18:46 <tahugamin> Welp, to to go capture an alien
16:18:49 <Excraylibur> no wait offside
16:18:52 <Excraylibur> woo
16:19:31 <Annalea> or... wait.
16:19:35 <Annalea> You said non-human life
16:19:38 <Annalea> What does that even mean
16:19:42 <tahugamin> Aliens?
16:19:51 <tahugamin> Animals? Plants?
16:19:57 <Kens|Labwork> Bacteria
16:20:02 <tahugamin>  /Fungi/
16:20:04 <Darktooth> Well. Non-human is a horrible word. 
16:20:06 <Pendragon> Here's another thing: http://hqwallbase.com/images/big/mist_creature-387501.jpg
16:20:11 <Annalea> What does "total enslavement of non-human life" even mean?
16:20:42 <Erku> Fire? I have seen precious few definitions of life that can't be applied to a campfire 
16:20:43 <Pendragon> I think he means terrestrial creatures.
16:21:15 <Pendragon> Tigers, monkeys, insects, etc. Although I see no use in enslaving insects.
16:21:20 <Annalea> ....
16:21:23 <Annalea> Who's doing the enslaving?
16:21:35 <Kens|Labwork> The corporations, man!
16:21:35 <Pendragon> Ask him. I'd assume humans.
16:21:37 <Kens|Labwork> The Man!
16:21:41 <Dmatix> Enslaving insects would be the most useful, if anything.
16:21:42 <Erku> Probably world of warcraft 
16:21:43 <Annalea> That's what I'm asking, jackass. :P
16:21:43 <Kens|Labwork> They've got them down pat.

16:25:02 <tahugamin> Well, I suppose complaining about realism in a game where you run around shooting lasers at aliens and can't wear nanofibre weave shirts and carry a scope at the same time... :P
16:25:04 <Tuomey> Erku: who are you complaining at
16:25:15 <Pendragon> He's complaining at me and Aelanna.
16:25:22 <Kens|Labwork> tahugamin: What are you talking about? That's true.

16:25:46 <AndarielHalo> what match
16:25:49 <Kens|Labwork> Gujzo: What do you mean?
16:25:50 <Tuomey> Gujzo: yes, but make sure and tell is if it's nsfw or a seizure risk

16:26:27 <Excraylibur> I thought you were watching the match
16:26:36 <AndarielHalo> I was playing as France in EU4 last night
16:26:44 <Annalea> tahugamin: Well, why in god's name did you put your assault next to a car that could explode? :p
16:26:47 <tahugamin> Car shot at a bit, 10 minutes later explodes hard enough to flip twice in the air and instakill
16:26:51 <Excraylibur> okay
16:26:51 <tahugamin> I DID NOT KNOW CARS EXPLODED
16:26:57 <Excraylibur> news flash
16:26:57 <Kens|Labwork> Dumbass
16:26:58 <AndarielHalo> had just barely conquered southern England after Portugal was keeping me from making the jump
16:26:59 <Excraylibur> cars explode
16:26:59 * Annalea facepalms
16:27:12 <Annalea> That soldier's blood is on your hands now.
16:27:14 <Excraylibur> they are, in fact, run on gasoline
16:27:14 <Tuomey> tahugamin: haven't you ever been to Belfast?
16:27:15 <tahugamin> :(
16:27:16 <AndarielHalo> I made friendly with Castille and besieged Portugal, forcing them to submit to white peace, then invaded England
16:27:17 <Annalea> THEY TRUSTED YOU TO KEEP THEM SAFE
16:27:19 <tahugamin> Tuomey: NBope!
16:27:23 <tahugamin> Annalea: D':

16:31:37 <Gujzo> Tahugamin how about that retired stormtrooper
16:31:45 <FlameShirt> I had to pay £1.07 for a litre.
16:31:47 <Annalea> You start this RP campaign, right
16:31:48 <FlameShirt> This is too much.
16:31:51 <Pendragon> Highest ranked guy I ever had was Colonel Buttfuck, best scout ever.
16:32:03 <tahugamin> Annalea: Yes, because as we all know, wearing a superlightweight piece of body armour, a better scopoe for your gun, and a grenade is /literally impossible/
16:32:10 <tahugamin> :P
16:32:18 <Annalea> your party of intrepid adventurers enter a lush valley ruled over by a baron, which is being terrorized by a dragon
16:32:41 <Gujzo> is that dragon smaug?
16:32:42 <Annalea> you gather supplies, enlist the help of some local leaders, and manage to slay the dragon
16:32:48 <Annalea> ... and then everything goes to hell
16:32:51 <Annalea> turns out
16:32:58 <Annalea> the entire local economy was dragon-based
16:33:02 <Tuomey> hah
16:33:03 <Gujzo> wat
16:33:13 <Annalea> the money to maintain the town came from adventurers' gold
16:33:13 <Dmatix> Heh. Sounds a lot like some of the stuff you see in the Witcher games.

16:34:45 <Dmatix> There's a quest with trolls that acts just like that in the second game.
16:34:47 <FlameShirt> :<
16:34:52 <Annalea> good news though
16:34:52 <Tuomey> And no one finds out about the plot twist until they actually "beat" the thing
16:34:55 <tahugamin> Sounds about right
16:34:57 <Annalea> something you should know about how damage works
16:35:03 <Kens|Labwork> Assuming you're talking about hard cider.
16:35:12 <Annalea> XCOM works on the concept of "bloodied"
16:35:13 <Annalea> that is
16:35:35 <Annalea> you have your basic guy, right? let's say he's a private with 5 hp and he's got normal body armor and a nano-fiber vest giving him 2 more hp
16:35:38 <Annalea> so he's got 8 hp total
16:35:49 <Annalea> so long as he doesn't lose more than the basic hp gained from items
16:35:54 <Annalea> he won't be considered 'wounded' after the battle
16:36:02 <Annalea> this doesn't seem like much consolation now, but
16:36:10 <Annalea> once you get into higher armor tiers? it's suddenly a big deal
16:36:18 <tahugamin> heh
16:36:26 <Bennings> 5+2= 8?  
16:36:26 <Annalea> a colonel with 10 hp, +10 from titan armor and +4 from chitin armor has 24 hp
16:36:37 <Darktooth> Someone here *PLEASE* yell at me for not researching my skip properly. 
16:36:40 <tahugamin> Bennings: The nano-fiber does 2, the normal body armour does 1, iirc
16:36:41 <Annalea> he can take up to 14 damage before he's considered wounded

16:37:25 <Annalea> they can continue to take damage and not be Wounded unless they hit the magic bloodied threshold

16:41:13 <Tuomey> Annalea: that's pretty kickass
16:41:21 <Gujzo> country music is unoriginal now a days
16:41:22 <Excraylibur> Annalea, I didn't know you have a deviantart
16:41:30 <Gujzo> its all about TRUCKS AND CHICKS
16:41:47 <Waterfire> I should make a deviantart, I could post doodles

16:42:48 <Excraylibur> I should try drawing sometime
16:42:57 <Darktooth> Or actually. Just take a white paper, put a small black box in the middle and call it "Modern Art" then watch it somehow sell for millions of dollars. 
16:42:58 <Excraylibur> Its not my forte, but what can I do, right?
16:42:59 <Waterfire> BRB
16:43:04 <Gujzo> Vorcha welcome to the club
16:43:06 <Pixeltasim> Annalea: I am curious how you made retrieval so fast
16:43:08 <Annalea> I only put finished stuff on dA... which is why I go for months at a time without posting
16:43:28 <Annalea> Pixel: By caching lookup tables in memory?
16:43:40 <Annalea> Don't tell me you're pulling everything from a flatfile on demand
16:43:42 <Darktooth> I feel like stuff is never finished. Just... Passable. 
16:43:43 <Gujzo> you ugys should lsiten this 12 minute swedish power metal

16:43:51 <Pixeltasim> Annalea: I basically have the same thing
16:43:53 <tahugamin> Hm... Battle scanner, or Disabling shot?
16:43:57 <Pixeltasim> I think I could make it more effecient though
16:44:00 <Vorcha> I thought you said you uglys
16:44:06 <Annalea> tahugamin: battlescanner
16:44:14 <Gujzo> this song has like 4 or 5 different guitar solos and 4 different song tones
16:44:17 <Echo> tahugamin: Fuck thgat
16:44:20 <Echo> Disabling shot
16:44:22 <Annalea> battlescanner opens up a lot of combos

16:45:20 <Excraylibur> just fite already
16:45:25 <Annalea> Echo focuses entirely on defense and making his guys impossible to kill.
16:45:28 <Darktooth> Pendragon. I don't know whether to hate you for that reference, or laugh. 
16:45:32 <Echo> If you're moving aggressively, and you've got all you lanes covered, you won't need a battle scanner anyway
16:45:42 <Pendragon> Why not both. A hatred laugh.
16:45:42 <tahugamin> ...wait, crap
16:45:42 <Annalea> I have a "if they're dead, they can't shoot back" strategy in general
16:45:44 <Excraylibur> MisterFlames, during those 7 episodes, Goku charges his power level.
16:45:50 <Echo>  Cuz you'll have mutually covered troops with eyes on where you're headed
16:45:54 <Tuomey> tahugamin: try and make your abilities compliment the ones you've picked already
16:46:08 <Excraylibur> clearly we need a Disabling Scanner
16:46:13 * tahugamin just accidentally lost their progress again
16:46:18 <MisterFlames> Thirty-five episodes.  And Goku isn't even in this fight.
16:46:19 <Annalea> ...?
16:46:21 <Gujzo> tahugamin gj
16:46:27 <Annalea> i feel like you need to turn autosave on

16:46:32 <Annalea> because this keeps happening
16:46:40 * Gujzo IS SERIOUSLY LOVING THIS POWER METAL

17:05:50 <Darktooth> I MISS HER!
17:05:59 <Darktooth> I've only known her for like a week. 
17:06:00 <Gujzo> we should all co create the worst SCP ever and name it crystal

17:06:36 <Gujzo> thenwe should call it not the 409 crystal :3
17:06:38 <DreadLindwyrm> Or someone's teeth becoming shark.
17:06:44 <Darktooth> You can find anything off of 682. I swear. 
17:06:47 <Gujzo> oh dude i first read 409 years ago
17:06:55 <Pendragon> By the way, there's no crystal for SCP-409.
17:06:59 <Pendragon> No picture.
17:07:02 <Gujzo> or like late 2012 or something i cant remember
17:07:09 <Darktooth> I thought there was?
17:07:15 <Pendragon> Now there isn't.
17:07:35 <Darktooth> Huh. Id ask why, but I'm an idiot.

17:10:36 <tahugamin> Also; does it really need the di- heh
17:10:47 <tahugamin> it was more the "is to be <dimensions> safe"
17:11:12 <Gujzo> oh wait
17:11:22 <tahugamin> You also have an extra full stop at the end of that sentance, and a missing full stop at the end of that paragraph.
17:11:22 <Gujzo> LOL
17:11:30 <tahugamin> Proofread moar plos :V
17:11:50 <Gujzo> i didnt see that thanks it was alte when i eidted that

17:13:04 <tahugamin> Second paragraph.... "any instances are to be incinerated, except for the instances that aren't to be incinerated"
17:13:09 <tahugamin> To paraphrase
17:13:50 <Gujzo> well the instances not to be incinerated are for refernece purposes
17:13:52 <Gujzo> I'll put that in
17:14:05 <tahugamin> It's the way you put that
17:14:12 <tahugamin> It's inconsistent, imo anyway.
17:14:30 <tahugamin> If you said something like "store these ones, incinerate the rest", that'd work better imo.
17:14:31 <Darktooth> Ima go infinitely tweek my skip. 
17:14:40 <Gujzo> the instances not incinerated are basically obsolete
17:14:50 <tahugamin> instead of "incinerate everything. Oh, but store these ones."
17:15:01 <tahugamin> Y'follow what I'm saying? :P

17:18:03 <Clockstop> that good?
17:18:30 <Gujzo> I see
17:18:33 <tahugamin> You are putting down an instruction that applies to all of the instances

17:18:53 <Gujzo> I just have to specify the differences
17:19:03 <Gujzo> or something along the lines of that
17:19:24 <tahugamin> If you put down that any inert instances or w/e are to be stored for reference, then say that, and /then/ say "destroy all the others"

17:25:31 <Kens|Labwork> What's up?
17:26:33 <Pendragon> I'm looking at pictures for 409, since I noticed the original pic got taken down, and I was wondering if I should PM you several pictures or something.
17:26:43 <Kens|Labwork> ?
17:27:06 <Kens|Labwork> Why do you want to send me photos?
17:27:07 <Pendragon> 409's original picture was Getty, right?
17:27:27 <tahugamin> Also, using only SCP-XXXX,  -1, -2 and -C in a skip is... weird, to me.

17:28:10 <Kens|Labwork> Oh, uh, don't send me any.
17:28:12 <tahugamin> Usually it's SCP-XXXX is the overall skip, the -1, -2, etc (or -A, -B, etc) refer to subparts of it, sometiems both are used, but you usually start at -1 and -A
17:28:14 <Gujzo> SCP-XXXX-c only shows up once too :/

17:49:31 <Gujzo> granite*
17:49:38 <Kens|Labwork> Just saying from a materials pov, that's what you would do.
17:49:38 <TheShrike> Grannie lined shotgun
17:49:47 <Gujzo> TheStrike ew
17:49:50 <Annalea> isn't granite really brittle, though?
17:49:52 <Gujzo> shrike*
17:49:54 <Gujzo> damnit
17:49:55 <Sophos> "grow granite"
17:49:59 <Annalea> like, wouldn't the stress of firing a shotgun shell shatter it?
17:50:01 <Sophos> Granite isn't even a mineral
17:50:12 <Kens|Labwork> Depends on how you grow it and design it.
17:50:16 <Pendragon> It *was* never said 409 was indestructible.
17:50:25 <Excraylibur> Another goal from France, but...
17:50:28 <Kens|Labwork> You theoretically could make it so the shattering angle was at a different angle from the forces of the blast.
17:50:29 <Excraylibur> It's an own goal!
17:50:35 <Gujzo> 2 minutes left
17:50:36 * Excraylibur cries in a corner
17:50:42 <Kens|Labwork> It wouldn't last very long, but it might get one or two shots off.
17:50:56 * Gujzo deosnt care
17:51:02 <Sophos> That just mini-yeah...
17:51:03 <Pendragon> How would we load the shotgun? Do they just carry 409 around wherever the shotgun goes?
17:51:06 <Gujzo> good thing I'm still in the cup amirite?
17:51:17 <Kens|Labwork> There's the possibility that they also just have a thing, nanometer-thick lining.
17:51:20 * Gujzo refers to yesterdays snippet moment
17:51:35 <Kens|Labwork> On the nanoscale, regular mechanical forcecs act differently.
17:51:37 <Sophos> nanometer = vaporises instantly
17:51:48 <Kens|Labwork> Not really, sophos.
17:52:06 <Kens|Labwork> You can have a 300nm thick oxide layer that withstands temperatures of 1200 degC+
17:52:08 <Pendragon> I think they would have used your idea in 409's containment chamber, rather than an entire chamber of granite.

17:57:07 <Annalea> yeah
17:57:11 <Kens|Labwork> Considering that amount of force and the number of homes, it was likely to have been running super high current.
17:57:12 <Annalea> one of our neighbors apparently saw it go down
17:57:19 <Annalea> the transformer exploded
17:57:26 <Annalea> set the power lines on fire

18:21:11 <Gujzo> what
18:21:15 <Gujzo> lol
18:21:19 <tahugamin> Annalea: So, where on a level from "easy" to "so very, very dead" are "moderate" and "very difficult" mission difficulties? :P
18:21:36 <Annalea> Uhhh
18:21:43 <TheRaven> Just do whichever has the reward you need most
18:21:47 <Annalea> Honestly I never paid much attention to the difficulty
18:21:48 <Annalea> yeah
18:21:49 <TheRaven> There's not a whole lot of difference
18:21:56 <Annalea> engineers if you need 'em
18:22:02 <Echo> tahugamin: That's just a measure of how many aliens there are on the mission
18:22:05 <Riemann> Silber.
18:22:05 <Annalea> then prioritize either money or panic reduction
18:22:09 <tahugamin> Echo: Ah
18:22:19 <Riemann> The Wall of Flesh is the easiest Hardmode boss
18:22:21 <TheShrike> And how much health they have, and their accuracy
18:22:22 <Echo> It's not very clear, but that's the only difference
18:22:27 <Pendragon> http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01886/praying-mantis_1886764i.jpg Ayyyyyyy
18:22:38 <Silber> full hellstone armor, 400 HP, imp minion, night's edge...
18:22:39 <Echo> TheShrike: We're not talkjing abotu difficulty in the game setting
18:22:40 <TheShrike> And how quickly panic builds
18:22:42 <tahugamin> Mexico has some panic, neither of the other two do, but... russia has 4 scientists. eeenh :I
18:22:47 <Echo> We're talking about monthly missions
18:22:48 <TheShrike> oh
18:22:51 <Riemann> It only ever gets harder
18:22:51 <Echo> That doesn't affect any of that
18:22:56 <Silber> Riemann: having to fight him in a lava pit didn't help
18:22:58 <TheShrike> Oh alright
18:23:04 <Silber> I had a lava charm, but still
18:23:20 <tahugamin> Guess I'm goin to mexico!
18:23:22 <Annalea> tahu
18:23:28 <tahugamin> Hm?
18:23:29 <Annalea> never, ever get scientists
18:23:30 <Silber> basicalle I was swimming with intermittent houses to jump out of the water and climb over
18:23:34 <Kens|Labwork> :(
18:23:36 <Echo> Scientists are worthless
18:23:38 <Annalea> scientists actually make the game harder
18:23:44 <Kens|Labwork> Annalea, Echo, why do you guys hurt me so.
18:23:46 <Annalea> faster research = game progresses faster
18:23:46 <tahugamin> I thought scientists were like, make research faster?
18:23:47 * Kens|Labwork cries.
18:23:51 <tahugamin> ....ah.
18:23:52 <Silber> Kvns is right there vou guvs
18:23:53 * Kens|Labwork runs.
18:23:54 <tahugamin> I see.
18:23:55 * Pendragon drinks Kens' tears
18:23:55 <Riemann> fuck you Kens
18:23:57 <Echo> Annalea: Actuyally
18:23:59 <Riemann> I am sad too
18:24:00 <Pendragon> You musn't run away kens
18:24:03 <Annalea> always prioritize engineers, that's how you get more satellites
18:24:04 <Riemann> <Echo> Scientists are worthless
18:24:05 <Riemann> :(
18:24:05 <Pendragon> get in the goddamn robot
18:24:08 <Echo> The aliens progress at their own speed
18:24:15 <Echo> But compared to engineers or cash
18:24:16 <Kens|Labwork> > prioritize engineers
18:24:17 * Kens|Labwork happier.
18:24:23 <Echo> Scientists are shit-tier
18:24:26 <tahugamin> Echo: The reward on this mission is actually a sniper
18:24:28 <Silber> Riemann how do I fight this thing
18:24:35 <Echo> You're either taking soldiers, engineers, or cash
18:24:47 <Riemann> Silber, what weapon are you using, and
18:24:50 <Pendragon> I don't take soldiers. I will name my guys Colonel Buttfuck if I want to.
18:24:55 <tahugamin> Even if you need to do panic reduction? :P
18:24:56 <Riemann> Have you made a really long bridge.
18:25:07 * Pendragon salutes the memory of Col. Heugh Buttfuck
18:25:16 <Echo> tahugamin: Panic reduction's good
18:25:28 <Silber> I did not makv a long bridge because I didn't know that it would just start shoving me west
18:25:37 <tahugamin> So, Imma take a wild guess here and assume that petrol pumps explode?
18:25:44 <Riemann> Yup, gotta make a bridge.
18:26:02 <Riemann> The WoF will spawn at the far side of the map, whichever side you're on
18:26:03 <Echo> Prioritize Panic Reduction, then engineers, then cash, unless you're literally bankrupt or need a satellite, then soldiers, unless you've got less than a full fire team, then scientists
18:26:04 <TheShrike> Anybody know die antwoord? I had a soldier named visser, so her callsign was yolandi
18:26:11 <Annalea> tahugamin: Yes, tahu.
18:26:19 <Riemann> If you're closer to the west side, he'll spawn at the far west and all.
18:26:22 * tahugamin sighs :(
18:26:22 <Annalea> pumps full of gasoline do in fact explode if exposed to plasma
18:26:27 <Annalea> however
18:26:30 <Annalea> you usually get a warning
18:26:32 <Pendragon> I'm gonna go play XCOM now.
18:26:35 <Echo> (or bullets too often)
18:26:35 <Annalea> if it lights on fire?
18:26:38 <Annalea> it explodes at the end of your turn
18:26:39 <Annalea> so
18:26:41 <clockstop> I love my new avatar
18:26:45 <Annalea> if the aliens light it on fire
18:26:48 <Annalea> get the fuck out of the way
18:27:04 <Echo> Lasers and plasma do the same damage to the environment; your ballistic weapons are significantly weaker against cover
18:27:11 <Echo> But a few missed shots can still destroy stuff
18:27:17 <tahugamin> The time I lost my assault, I think it was actually me that set the car alight.
18:27:31 <tahugamin> I just didn't realise it wasn't already on fire >.>
18:27:52 <Annalea> :p
18:27:57 <Annalea> i remember my first playthrough
18:27:57 <tahugamin> So, yeah.
18:28:01 <Annalea> i lost a lot of people to stupid things
18:28:03 <tahugamin> Right now I'm in a petrol station
18:28:08 <Annalea> second runthrough was a lot more fun
18:28:11 <tahugamin> This is the only nearby cover
18:28:24 <tahugamin> cars, pumps, n pillars right next to pumps.
18:28:31 <RobWatson> which game?
18:28:41 <PendrXCOM> How many times do you have to install DirectX for windows, steam.
18:28:42 <Kens|Labwork> Secret of the Magic Crystals.
18:28:56 <PendrXCOM> Sounds like a barney movie.
18:29:02 <tahugamin> And I just shot straight through a brick wall with a normal gun
18:29:07 <tahugamin> Riiiight.

19:07:23 <Annalea> make sure you have at least 3 stacks of ammo
19:07:31 <Annalea> preferably 4 if you can afford it
19:07:37 <Annalea> the minishark chews through ammo damned fast
19:08:05 <Silber> melee didn't work
19:08:32 <Silber> I could go full magic with that "auto-use mana potions" equip
19:08:49 <Annalea> melee is generally really gimmicky
19:08:57 <Reach> Gaffsey: Up-boated.
19:08:58 <Annalea> and basically involves having to have ranged lifesteal weapons

19:09:05 <Gaffsey> :D
19:09:07 <Annalea> because you're basically guaranteed to take damage
19:09:12 <Annalea> that's why my team character is ranged :V
19:09:25 <Annalea> I do damage from safe distances while the tankier characters get the boss's attention
19:09:42 <Silber> Annalea: I just need a weapon setup to take down Wall of Flesh

19:09:54 <Annalea> the minishark is fine
19:10:01 <Annalea> did you build a hellbridge, though?
19:10:09 <Silber> I'll take an ammo reservation potion
19:10:18 <Annalea> the most key part of taking down wall of flesh is having a long straight path to run
19:10:25 <Silber> also I went into Wall of Flesh not knowing how it works
19:10:27 <Silber> so, no
19:10:30 <Annalea> ahhhh
19:10:30 <Annalea> well
19:10:34 <Annalea> this is what I suggest
19:10:48 <Annalea> go to one of the ends of hell -- WoF always spawns on the closest end
19:10:55 <Annalea> and build a 1-block-thick straight bridge leading away
19:10:59 <Annalea> as long as you need to make it
19:11:07 <Annalea> probably go through a full stack of dirt/rock/whatever
19:11:15 <Annalea> punch through buildings if you have to
19:11:20 <Annalea> make soft ramps if you have to change elevation to avoid lava
19:11:25 <Annalea> and try to maintain a clear line of fire
19:11:34 <Silber> geez
19:11:35 <Annalea> you will be running in one direction constantly
19:11:45 <Annalea> and firing nonstop behind you as you run
19:11:57 <Annalea> you need the space to gain distance so you have time to kill the spawned adds
19:12:05 <Annalea> and whatever misses the adds hits the boss
19:12:42 <Silber> I have to build a bridge spanning across hell?
19:12:48 <Annalea> not all the way across
19:12:54 <Annalea> but at least 300-400 long
19:13:05 <Annalea> maybe longer to be safe; I haven't tried taking down WoF alone, ever
19:13:18 <Silber> or a highway, vou might sav
19:13:21 <Annalea> yes
19:13:28 <Annalea> in fact you can build a literal highway once you get into hardmode
19:13:34 <Silber> a highway parallel to hell
19:13:35 <Annalea> by using asphalt, which increases runspeed while you're on it :>
19:13:39 <tahugamin> Welp, if anybody is interested in me being not very good at XCOM, http://www.twitch.tv/tahunu :P
19:13:40 <Annalea> YEP
19:13:51 * Silber guitar riff
19:13:59 <Annalea> basically, silber
19:14:04 <Annalea> for 90% of bossfights in terraria
19:14:25 <Annalea> you will want to build an arena to exploit the boss's weaknesses, until the point at which you can trivialize them by gear
19:14:49 <Silber> I don't think I have the connection qualitv to grab someone and get help taking it down
19:14:50 <Annalea> especially if you're not melee (and therefore can't afford to take too much damage)
19:15:02 <Annalea> what kind of internet do you have?

20:03:40 <Echo> Individuals resisting =/= the country of France
20:03:44 <ProcyonLotor> That's... not what surrender means
20:04:02 <ProcyonLotor> This is like, the eighteenth time you've made a historical claim that is just outright incorrect
20:04:11 <AndarielHalo> no it's not
20:04:41 <Echo> Then you have little understanding of what the words resistance or surrender mean.

20:06:33 <Gujzo> I wanna see something: how many copies of the decleration of Independance (US) do you know of?
20:06:52 <AndarielHalo> when?
20:07:22 <Gujzo> there were only a certain amount of original copies ( my bad)
20:07:26 <AndarielHalo> o
20:08:05 <Gujzo> 0 is your answer?
20:08:06 <AndarielHalo> iunno the exact number but they had a bunch of them
20:08:10 <Gujzo> nevermind
20:08:13 <Gujzo> there are 3
20:08:17 <AndarielHalo> because the signers weren't all gathered in one place, they signed different copies
20:08:33 <Gujzo> 1 in the US, another in the UK, and another in France
20:08:45 <Gujzo> and they exist there today :D
20:09:12 <AndarielHalo> final published versions yes

20:16:43 <Gujzo> if anyone is interested, I have a website dedicated to cringe fuel
20:16:43 <Bennings> Why is starting something always the most difficult part?
20:16:59 <AndarielHalo> starting requires the most energy
20:17:08 <AndarielHalo> to go from doing nothing to doing something
20:17:11 <Bunton> It requires you to make something out of nothing.
20:17:16 <Echo> However
20:17:17 <Eskaway> I actually heard from a prominent Western philosopher that waiting was the hardest part.
20:17:24 <Echo> Going from 1% of something
20:17:27 <Bunton> While everything from after the start is an extension of something.
20:17:30 <Bouncl> nah
20:17:33 <Echo> And filling out the rest of that 99% of something to finish it
20:17:34 <Bouncl> the hardest part is letting go
20:17:37 <Bouncl> not taking part 
20:17:39 <Eskaway> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMyCa35_mOg
20:17:41 <Echo> Takes way more energy than getting started

20:18:25 <Reach> Hello, lads and lasses! :D 
20:18:27 <Bunton> I think people notice it more because it's easier to notice ideas that never went anywhere.
20:18:37 <Len> Hello, Reach.
20:18:38 <Bennings> Oh hai Reach.
20:18:45 <Bunton> And you'll always have more of those than things you've spent a lot of time finishing.
20:18:47 <Echo> Eskaway: You heard wrong. I have it on good authority that the hardest part was my last romp with your mom.
20:19:06 <Reach> o/
20:19:07 <AndarielHalo> now i hae that song stuck in my head =(
20:19:18 <Bennings> Your mum jokes.  Mature.
20:19:28 <Eskaway> echo: You understand that literally the only appeal you have for my mom is the fact that you use words like "romp".
20:19:43 <Reach> .g romp
20:19:51 <Reach> Unexpected!
20:19:59 <Reach> But not the command I wanted.
20:20:01 <Reach> .def romp
20:20:02 <Eskaway> It reminds her of her childhood in the 50s, with the sock hops and the soda fountains and the overt institutionalized racism she'd be protesting against later.

21:10:38 <ProcyonLotor> There isn't anyway to directly put up images, and thank god for that.
21:10:50 <Gujzo> ProcyonLotor thanks
21:10:55 <Gujzo> finally someone tells me
21:11:03 <ProcyonLotor> I told you earlier.
21:11:24 <Bennings> Wasn't it just paste the image web address, or am I wrong about that?
21:11:41 <ProcyonLotor> That only works on Mibbit
21:11:42 <Tuomey> It doesn't work with images from that fucking meme site
21:11:45 <Gujzo> oh
21:11:45 <ProcyonLotor> One of the reasons mibbit is awful.
21:11:48 <Gujzo> didnt know that
21:11:50 <Tuomey> That's the problem
21:12:04 <Tuomey> ProcyonLotor: you can turn it off on mibbit pretty easily
21:12:19 <Bennings> How?
21:12:26 <Tuomey> .g mibbit images
21:12:42 <Tuomey> this should tell you

23:03:13 <Faminepulse> actually
23:03:17 <Faminepulse> i cant do eight bit stuff
23:03:24 * Reese_Sparrow rises from grave once again
23:03:30 <Faminepulse> i just know how to manipulate sound
23:03:36 <Faminepulse> i don't have any musical knowledge
23:03:39 <Faminepulse> i misread the request

23:04:12 <Faminepulse> Roget, hornby?
23:04:24 <Faminepulse> whos the music guy? thats not me
23:05:17 <Photosynthetic> Hm. Faminepulse, if I wrote some kind of boss-battle tune and sent you a MIDI, could you make it sound 8-bit?
23:05:55 <Faminepulse> I've tried that before. An eight bit song to my knowledge is carefully crafted
23:05:58 <Faminepulse> it cant just be converted
23:06:03 <Faminepulse> the whole thing is a long process
23:06:12 <Faminepulse> i don't have the specific knowledge, that's something of a project
23:06:46 <Photosynthetic> Damn.
23:06:58 <Faminepulse> I reccomend downloading a program called Fruity Loops and playing with the 8 Bit package
23:07:10 <Photosynthetic> I can compose music, but I have no idea how to --
23:07:13 <Photosynthetic> oh? How does that work?
23:07:46 <Reese_Sparrow> anyone ever tried using that music composition program noatikl? or whatever its called?
23:07:48 <Faminepulse> well there's an interface and you choose different sounds, and a bunch of other stuff you can more or less ignore
23:07:57 <lurkd> Photosynthetic, if you can do some Kirby boss battle music, that would be killer.
23:07:59 <Roget> .tag goi2014
23:08:03 <Roget> heh
23:08:20 <Photosynthetic> Well, advance warning, I haven't played Kirby in literally over ten years.
23:09:12 <pure> Good evening, skippers.
23:09:23 <Faminepulse> this is my favorite kirby song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppXhpVx5iDQ
23:09:26 <Faminepulse> and battle
23:09:39 <Faminepulse> marx is fuckan awesome
23:09:41 <Photosynthetic> If you can drop me a couple Youtube links to music of styles similar to what you're looking for, I could scribble something together for you, no problem: the trouble is that I'm a composer, not a sound engineer, and I'm regrettably ignorant of the specifically 8-bit compositional process.
23:09:57 <Photosynthetic> I am also tied up in field season and have no time to learn new software. >_<
23:09:57 <Reese_Sparrow> anyone care to read a crappy draft?
23:11:19 <Faminepulse> Photosynthetic, Hornby is the resident sound guy I believe. I just manipulate sound for creepy audio logs n shit
23:11:24 <Faminepulse> he might know
23:11:26 <Faminepulse> .seen hornby
23:11:49 <Photosynthetic> Hm. Lurk, you might want to communicate with Hornby, then. Find out what he can do.

23:15:01 <Roget> *pimping intensifies*
23:16:01 <Mrtdark1> Is this for he GOI thing
23:16:45 <Roget> yes
23:17:00 <lurkd> Roget, I trust your judgement in giving photosynthetic some inspiration when it comes to 8-bit pieces.  :P
23:17:02 <Mrtdark1> I wish I applied sooner
23:17:21 <Mrtdark1> Also, which would be a better GOI:
23:17:25 <lurkd> Considering your collection/knowledge in such things
23:17:34 <Roget> Photosynthetic, yo want some 8-bit pieces
23:17:48 <Mrtdark1> A house or somebody with no power or expertise in anomalous objects
23:17:53 <Photosynthetic> Roget, hold off until we know whether anyone can take a MIDI and make it sound 8-bit.
23:18:13 <Photosynthetic> Mrtdark1: I don't understand how either of those makes a GOI at all, sorry.
23:18:23 <Roget> Photosynthetic, have you read my teams GoI tales yet
23:18:28 <Photosynthetic> Er, and Roget, by "anyone" I mean "probably Hornby." >_<
23:18:42 <Photosynthetic> No, I haven't; I've been in the field for two weeks with next to no Internet access.
23:18:47 <lurkd> Just googling here and there, seems to be some sites with royalty free 8-bit music.  Would that be kosher?
23:18:50 <Roget> You should check them out, I linked them above
23:18:51 <Mrtdark1> @Photosynthetic he house would be anomalous
23:19:14 <Roget> lurkd, if you credited the source in the discussion page and, if appropriate, asked the creators to use it
23:19:17 <Mrtdark1> And the other one would be a blogger
23:19:19 <Photosynthetic> lurkd: Not unless you have the composer's permission to release that music under Creative Commons.
23:19:36 <lurkd> Right.
23:19:38 <Roget> If you can find some CC 8bit music
23:19:39 <Roget> man
23:19:42 <Roget> that'd be spiffy
23:19:50 <DoomDude1> Command and Conquer?
23:19:51 <lurkd> hmmm
23:19:52 <Photosynthetic> Or, once again, if you can make some. ;)
23:20:18 <Mrtdark1> @DD Creative Commons
23:20:21 <Photosynthetic> Mrtdark1: Neither of those gives me enough information to judge the idea's merits.
23:20:41 <Mrtdark1> @photosynthetic I know
23:20:45 <Photosynthetic> Haha, yes, though -- CC is Creative Commons. Not Command & Conquer. XD
23:20:54 <Mrtdark1> I'm still working on it
23:21:22 <Mrtdark1> I have an SCP idea for the last one
23:21:27 <Roget> I've been developing a GoI, a group that makes custom dreams, in the broad sense of the word. The first SCP with them was a custom dream company, the second was Walt Disneys frozen head that rang people up to ask about making EPCOT like his dream
23:21:44 <Roget> the third is a dreamcatcher that catches nightmares, that GottaGoFeast wrote
23:21:50 <Mrtdark1> @Roget can I see t

23:23:15 <lurkd> Roget, you think it'd be fine to post an ad in the forums for someone to make me some chip music?
23:23:18 <Roget> these are the Oneroi Collective SCP articles
23:23:26 <Mrtdark1> Make a tag
23:23:30 <Roget> lurkd, yes that is appropriate. In one of the help forums, or maybe general
23:23:36 <lurkd> kk
23:23:37 <Roget> Mrtdark1, I don't have enough articles to justify it
23:23:37 <Roget> yet
23:23:39 <Photosynthetic> Mrtdark1: That's not quite how it works.
23:23:58 <Photosynthetic> You develop a GOI with multiple -- numerous -- articles, and if it catches on, *then* it can earn its tag.
23:24:03 <Roget> I think the standard is going to change after the GoI contest though

23:24:55 <Mrtdark1> But I conur with 2+ articles made by 2+ people
23:24:56 <Roget> it has some highly rated articles and more than one author
23:25:07 <Mrtdark1> @Roget I think it'd work
23:25:38 <Roget> I wouldn't be personally satisfied pushing it as a GoI with the content level it currently has
23:25:58 <Mrtdark1> I'd be willing to write one
23:26:00 <Roget> It would not fulfill me artistically to push it out before I think it has enough content
23:26:02 <Photosynthetic> It'd need more than just two. I'd argue for five, unless the smaller number -- *certainly* no less than three -- were /really fantastic./
23:26:07 <Roget> If you want to, you're more than welcome
23:26:20 <Roget> Photosynthetic, two of the three are almost at +100 currently
23:26:25 <Roget> (those are the ones I wrote)
23:26:38 <Mrtdark1> Though I want to finish my first article that doesn't take place anywhere but the foundation
23:26:48 <Photosynthetic> Dang. :) Nice work, Roget.
23:27:02 <Photosynthetic> .author Mrtdark1
23:27:06 <Roget> I want to write another one, but I'm waiting for a good idea
23:27:07 <Mrtdark1> Speaking of that, I have a question
23:27:22 <Photosynthetic> Oh?
23:27:33 <Mrtdark1> I did write another article, but I deleted it
23:28:08 <Mrtdark1> (That wasn't the question)
23:28:50 <Reese_Sparrow> http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/dr-sparrow-s-draftbox
23:28:56 <Mrtdark1> If I want to convey an alien ecosystem with something insidious at the center, what would work: Exploration log or Retrieved Materials list
23:28:57 <Reese_Sparrow> looking for opinions on first tab :o
23:29:50 <Photosynthetic> Mrtdark1: Either one could work. I don't have enough information to judge specifics.
23:30:41 <Photosynthetic> I'd lean toward the exploration log, generally, but either *could* work if done well. THAT SAID, if you need excess logs to convey the heart of the article, you may be doing it wrong: most of our readers dislike that kind of gimmick quite a lot.

23:31:34 <Mrtdark1> (Ant Farm)
23:31:49 <Photosynthetic> One log is "excess" if the point doesn't come across well enough in the main article.

23:32:48 <Photosynthetic> Can you explain here?
23:33:03 <ProcyonLotor> Exploration logs are hard as hell to do
23:33:25 <Reese_Sparrow> although if done correctly they can be /amazing/
23:33:30 <ProcyonLotor> A good bet is that if you cannot make the article work on its own, you will not be able to save it with an exploration log
23:34:03 <Reese_Sparrow> i've seen one or two where the exploration log makes the article
